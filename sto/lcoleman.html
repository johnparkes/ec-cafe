            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Over Memorial Day Weekend 2003 and the following weekend, a series
              of &quot;upset stomachs&quot; gave me some problems. Since Carolee
              and I were departing on a trip to Russia, I wanted to ensure I
              didn't have problems in rural Russia. I couldn't make an appointment
              with my regular gastroenterologist, Dr. Pamela Connors while she
              was on maternity leave until October. The first appointment I could
              get with her partner Dr. Bradford Lavigne was in late July. I went
              to my PCP and internist Dr. Walter Lentz to get a prescription
              to handle the symptoms of an ulcer while I was away. I was given
              a Prevacid which combines a strong acid blocker and medicine to
              kill H-pylori. Throughout the trip to Russia, in spite of jet lag
              and odd foods, I had no digestive upset. All went very well. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="red"><em>Occasionally I will make an aside about the conclusion of something
                  which happened later than the date noted. It will be in this
                  red color.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>July 27</strong> Upon my return to the USA, no problems
              occurred. I began to think that my appointment would make me look
              like a prize hypochondriac. On the evening before I was scheduled
              to see Dr. Lavigne, suddenly I had a sharp attack around 6 PM.</p>
            <p><strong>July 28</strong> (2003) I had my appointment with Dr.
              Bradford Lavigne for the odd sensation in my stomach which I suspected
              might be an ulcer forming. Dr. Lavigne asked if I had trouble swallowing,
              had nausea or changes in my bowel movements [no to all]. Dr. Lavigne
              wished to examine me with an endoscope as soon as possible. He
              also wanted some blood work as soon as possible. I remarked to
              the phlebotomist that 5 large test tubes of blood seemed unusual.
              She said that I was having tests for white and red blood cell counts,
              liver function, blood consistency and density, standard block testing
              and perhaps other tests which I could not remember. I thought this
              was a bit much for a stomach problem but I figured Dr. Lavigne
              was just being thorough.</p>
            <p><strong>July 29 </strong>I had endoscopy at Westerly Hospital.
              Upon awakening Dr. Lavigne told Carolee and I that he had found
              a cancer in my esophagus. He has taken 8 biopsies. In retrospect,
              we should have known something serious was occurring when Dr. Lavigne
              wanted us in at 6 AM after the first appointment but the diagnosis
              of cancer was totally unexpected. The blood work including liver
              function and counts of white and red blood cells should also have
              tipped me off, but I simply did not make the association.</p>
            <p>The remainder of today and the next day were passed in a complete
              funk. As I went online to find out more about EC, I went from dreadfully
              upset to almost paralysis. 95% mortality within 18 months is not
              a diagnosis anyone wants to hear. What I did not know then and
              was not to find out for sometime was that I had a 50/50% chance
              of being in the lucky 5%. In reality, the numbers are something
              like 90% of the EC suffers have no chance at long term survival,
              and about 10% have a realistic 50/50% chance of long term survival.
              The stage is very critical. Stage 0, cancer &quot;in situ&quot; (a
              unattached self contained cancer) at 75%, Stage 1 - cancer contained
              in innermost two tubes of the esophagus 50% all the way down to
              Stage IV - remote metastasis is less than 1%. </p>
            <p><strong>July 24</strong>  Somewhere during these two days, an aspect of my
              personalty arose that I had never suspected. A no nonsense fiercely
              focused hardened core took over ever time I needed to make a grim
              decision or I began to panic. When Tim visited me a few days later
              he said that he knew how frightened I must be, and I was startled
              to hear myself say in all truth that I wasn't frightened at all.
              I felt angry and vengeance at the disease, concern and grief that
              I might leave Carolee a widow, but I had absolutely no personal
              fear. When I needed to do hard things or understand hard choices,
              a hardened and resolved core was there buffering my kinder gentler
              selves from the grim realities. All the harden core cared about
              was percentages, best outcomes and what we had to do to make sure
              I gave myself the best possible chance. The hardened core made
              sure that I picked up my physical activity, swimming longer and
              faster. Over the weeks to follow, while I suffered periodic depression
              at the nastiness of what was happening, and in particular each
              setback be it dumping, weight loss or weakness, I never was fearful. </p>
            <p><strong>July 29</strong> At 1:30, Carolee, Kevin, Mary and I met
              with Dr. Lavigne when the pathology report was back. He showed
              us the endoscopic picture of cancer.</p>
            <img src="/sto/lcoleman.jpg" alt="tumor endoscopy photographs" width="610" height="464" border="0">
            <p>The situation is that the tumor is in its early stages. The cells
              look like the cells of the esophagus rather than the wildly undifferentiated
              cells of a late stage tumor. There are no signs of spreading. The
              liver shows neither signs of penetration in the CT Scan. This is
              confirmed by a positive liver function blood test. Lymph nodes
              in the area do not appear to be enlarged, but it is not possible
              from a CT Scan alone to determine if they harbor breakaway tumor
              cells yet. </p>
            <p>There are various ways to specify the staging of a tumor. It can
              be done from visual examination, from a biopsy, from CT and PET
              Scans, from ultrasound endoscopy but the definitive staging can
              only be determined after surgical removal of the effected area
              and pathology of the diseased tissue. Dr. Lavigne has arranged
              a meeting with Dr. Robert Knisley, who is now my medical oncologist.
              Dr. Lavigne is essentially turning over management to Dr. Knisley
              at this point. The tumor is about the size of my thumb pointing
              down to my stomach. They have been confirmed as a moderately well
              defined adinocarcinoma (pathology by Dr. Paul Cardi at Westerly
              Hospital confirmed by Dr. Robert Odze at Brigham & Women's Hospital
              in Boston on August 4th). The tumor has not wrapped around the
              esophagus; it does not look aggressive; it is moderately well differentiated;
              and does not show discoloration. All of these are positive signs.
              It tentatively identified the tumor as an <strong>adenocarcinoma
              of the Barrett's Esophagus</strong>  (which has proved to be a
              correct diagnosis). </p>
            <p><strong>August 1</strong>  I've had CT Scan and X-rays at Westerly Hospital
              today. My lab work tested a wide variety of things including liver
              function. The CT Scan dye burned when it was pumped in my arm.
              Over the next few days, I developed a bumpy rash (hives?) which
              various doctors confirmed was an allergy to the dye. The tests
              at Westerly Hospital did not reveal any additional nodes of cancer. </p>
            <p><strong>August 5</strong>  Carolee and I had our first meeting with Dr. Knisley.
              Dr. Knisley and his partner Dr. Robert Lagare strongly feel I should
              go out of state for surgery. He suggested that Memorial Sloan-Kettering
              and Massachusetts General Hospital [MGH] have fine programs. [Dr.
              Knisley discussed possible surgeons and he and Dr. Lagare suggested
              Dr. Henning Gaissert. With Kevin's help we discovered that Dr.
              Gaissert is indeed a fine EC surgeon.] </p>
            <p><strong>August 11</strong>  Carolee and I had our first meeting with Dr.
              Gaissert. It is very important to have confidence in your surgeon.
              What he does has life altering changes on your body. Not only does
              a doctor hold your life in his hands, his ability to communicate
              with you can foster or inhibit the vital flow of information. We
              are favorably impressed with Dr. Gaissert. I felt very comfortable
              with him as did Carolee. Dr. Gaissert will be on leave until early
              September but I am already scheduled for surgery on September 5th
              (Friday). </p>
            <p>We were amazed how sensitive a huge hospital like MGH can be with
              severely ill patients such as myself. I later came to realize that
              MGH is more a collection of little intimate &quot;villages&quot; each
              focusing on a particular area. The whole is bound together by an &quot;state
              government&quot; where a single village just isn't enough. Some
              villages serve other villages (the shopping area, restaurants,
              and administration), other villages treat a condition (maternity
              or a kind of cancer) and still other villages deal with common
              needs (X-ray, physiotherapy etc.). I never dealt with MGH as a
              whole but just those folks with a special interest in my disease.
              It seemed that everyone knew who I was and what I needed. Communication
              was great and unobtrusive. </p>
            <p>Dr. Gaissert's physician's aide Andrea (last name?) discussed
              the details of the surgery with us. I will have a Jejunum Tube
              (J-tube) inserted in lower left side for feeding (&quot;chocolate
              milk shake on a pole&quot; [yah right and hamburger is porterhouse
              steak]). I will awake with multiple tubes, in bladder, nose, back
              (epidural drip), a drain in my lower neck, various ports in my
              arms, possibly a vein tube leading to my heart (never had it) and
              a mouth tube (taken out before I awoke). There will be many feeding
              machines, monitors. I can expect to take a barium swallow on the
              7th day if all goes very well, and physical therapy will begin
              on the 2nd or 3rd day (I forced the issue by starting to walk immediately
              after sitting up on day 1). I will have chest X-rays every day
              (initially via portable unit, then by going down to the 2nd floor.
              I will start on a series of diets starting with liquids and finally
              going to anything goes 4-5 weeks later. If J-tube falls out I have
              to get it inserted immediately - preferably at Westerly Hospital
              Emergency Room (never a problem). J-tube may be left in for chemotherapy
              and radiation. Andrea is on the floor of Ellison 19 (my home away
              from home). </p>
            <p><strong>August 12</strong>  Dr. Knisley called to see how things went with
              MGH. We said they went very well and that we were very favorably
              impressed with Dr. Gaissert. </p>
            <p><strong>August 25</strong>  My 9 AM PET [Positron Emission Tomography ] Scan
              began in the MGH White Building's Nuclear Medicine on Floor 2.
              At 9:25 I was given some radioactive glucose. Just prior to the
              injection, they drew blood through the same port. My blood sugar
              level prior to injection and after a 17 hour fast was 85 where
              80-120 is ideal. The actual PET Scanning began at 10:30 in a trailer
              when MGH houses its second PET Scanner. The technician Lesley Lenher.
              It was uneventful except that my arms (held above my head due to
              the very narrow PET Scanner opening) grew painfully cramped. The
              whole session took about an hour. The PET Scan showed no remote
              metastatic nodes. </p>
            <p>Carolee and I then went up to the GI Specialists in MGH Blake
              Floor 4. We had a bit of confusion about when it was scheduled.
              We thought that it was for 1 PM with a 12 Noon check-in. In fact
              it was 2 & 1 PM. I had a complete medical history taken by a nurse
              [Judy?]. She hooked me up to blood pressure, heart & pulmonary
              monitors, started me on an IV. About 3 PM I was wheeled into the
              procedure room. An unknown resident asked me my entire history
              again, checked that I knew what the procedure was for and tried
              to explain ultrasound to me. [I understand ultrasound at least
              as well as he explained it but he was doing his job.] My actual
              ultrasonic endoscope was conducted by Dr. Brenna Bounds who I met
              just prior to sedation. Dr. Bounds has tentatively suggested a
              single tumor (possibly 2) with no nodes involved. </p>
            <p><strong>September 2</strong>  In a phone conversation with Dr. Gaissert,
              we confirm that surgery is on for Friday. I am very anxious to
              get started. </p>
            <p><strong>September 3</strong>  We arrived at Boston two days early so that
              I can take the much dreaded Golitely. This will be my last real
              meal perhaps forever, because of limits on how much I can eat. <em class="red">My
              outlook about eating normally proved to be much too pessimistic.
              A year later I was fine.</em> They gave me a full dose of Golitely
              with strong antibiotics. With my tendency to diarrhea, this was
              massive overkill. </p>
            <p><strong>September 4</strong>  A series of tests were scheduled today on an
              outpatient basis. I did not find out until later that these were
              crucial tests. Failing anyone of them meant that surgery was off.
              Blood work (many vials) were taken at 12 Noon. I moved to the Pulmonary
              Testing Unit [MGH Bigelow Room 952] at 1 PM with technician Barry
              Callahan. I was told that I had to have spare capacity if surgery
              went awry. I was asked to blow hard into an initial machine before
              the more serious test began. After looking at this test Barry said
              the rest of the tests would be pro-forma. I did tests in hyperbaric
              chambers, lung capacity tests, pressure test and what Barry said
              would be the worst - the treadmill. Actually as I waited for the
              treadmill to come up to speed, Barry announced everything was done.
              I normally run the treadmill twice as fast at the YMCA and didn't
              understand that I had already passed. By 2 PM I was in for an EKG
              and a discussion of how the blood tests went (fine including the
              crucial liver tests for cancer spread). </p>
            <p>We moved to the Grey Building's Admitting area where things began
              by checking insurance and signing lots of waivers saying MGH could
              share what they learned with people involved in my treatment. I
              had a nurse interview with Hilda Morrison who explained all the
              support services. I learned I would have to arrive at the hospital
              by 5:30 AM. I was told not to bring anything at all. Hilda explained
              many support features available at MGH if I needed them. She was
              exceedingly kind and gentle. </p>
            <p>My final interview was with Anesthesiologist Dr. Annetta Murphy.
              She explained that two types of anesthesiology would be used -
              general (by mouth and via a port in my hand) and epidural (via
              a tube in my back). Dr. Murphy repeated all the tubes that I might
              encounter. She explained the common side effects and explained
              that while very rare, epidural sometimes caused paralysis. She
              stressed that long surgeries like mine were stressful to the body
              and that I would probably not be moved from the ICU to acute care
              (Ellison 19) for a minimum of 24 hours (I actually was ready to
              be moved 8 hours later but they held off until morning). </p>
            <p>Tim came the evening before surgery and met us in the room. We
              planned to meet early to go over for the early admissions. </p>
            <p><strong>September 5</strong>  Carolee, Tim and I arrived at the admitting
              area in Wang by 5:30 AM in the Same Day Surgical Admission area.
              I was scheduled for the very first access to the surgical area
              (a blessing not to be hung up waiting for one to free up). It wasn't
              long until I was admitted and shortly afterwards I was on a gurney
              in a hospital dickey wrapped up in some warmed blankets. [MGH keeps
              preheated blankets in warming cabinets for patients who are chilly
              - bless whoever thought this one up.] I moved down to surgical
              ward 8 and was in an alcove while the room was set up. I met for
              the first time a head resident (?) Dr. James Cacciatola who prepped
              me for the surgery and started the anesthesia. </p>
            <p>From here until the evening I have no recollection. Surgery was
              rapid and without complications. Within 5-1/2 hours
              Dr. Gaissert told Carolee and the others that all was well. It
              was sometime in the evening until I awoke enough to know my family
              was close but I still was very groggy and cannot say much of what
              happened. Visual examination indicated the cancer had not spread
              at all but pathology (several days later) discovered a few escaped
              cells in one out of thirty nodes. </p>
              <p>The following are Carolee's notes about the day: 
              </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="style1">            &quot;Surgery began at 8:15. We had updates
                from rotating nurses Gloria and Katy who said that Les' surgery
                was going well and that Les was stable. We met with Dr. Gaissert
                at 1:45 who said that everything went according to plan. There
                was no [visible] evidence of spread. They took nearby lymph nodes
                for a biopsy whose results are due in 6 to 7 days. Les is still
                groggy, in some pain, is connected to lots of tubes and looks
                good considering.

              <p><em>            &quot;We visited Les in the ICU at 6:45. He was more
                  alert and in more pain. When a nurse told him to take a few
                  deep breaths, it was very painful for him. The nurse removed
                  the oxygen mask briefly to make talking easier but soon had
                  to put it back on. Les wanted to know exactly where he was.

            <p><strong>September 6</strong>  In the early morning hours I finally really
              awoke. I was asked how painful things were for me. I said that
              I knew what real pain was having passed a 5 mm &quot;arrowhead&quot; kidney
              stone. (It doubled me up with pain in spite of a heavy dose of
              morphine.) Using that as a 10 I said I was hurting no worse than
              a 3. Medication was given and pain dropped back to background and
              never got as bad the rest of the day. I was told that after breakfast
              I would be moved to Ellison 19. Time dragged incredibly slowly.
              I was about the only patient in the ICU, at least at the far end
              where I was. Others had left the evening before. I heard a Code
              Blue come over the loudspeaker down in &quot;Eat Street&quot; the
              MGH main cafeteria but other than that everything was very slow. </p>
            <p>At 6:30 AM, a man came down with a portable X-ray machine and
              slid a film under my back. I felt like a leaden blanket, unable
              to do much more than grunt. The X-ray technician was upset that
              the film was bad until it was explained by a nurse that &quot;No,
              it isn't bad, his stomach really is under his collarbone now.&quot; I
              could feel my legs but my body from my diaphragm to my groin was
              totally numb. </p>
            <p>Somewhere around 7 Carolee and Kevin were admitted. I told them
              I was scheduled to go up to Ellison 19 earlier rather than later.
              When we finally got to Ellison 19, I was placed initially on the
              inner bed. The view from the far bed was spectacular. My first
              roommate was going home after having almost identical surgery.
              We asked for and got the window bed when he left. What an incredible
              view of Harvard, MIT, the Charles River, and the Esplanade. Outside
              I would watch the traffic on Storrow Drive, or the crew rowers
              and scullers zipping under one bridge or another. I could see the
              Red Line Trains going across the bridge below, watch softball teams,
              cyclists and runners on the path and had a wonderful view day and
              night </p>
            <p><strong>September 7-12</strong>  Ellison 19th floor is also known as by everyone
              as <strong>Thoracic Park</strong> . It comes complete with island map and
              dinosaurs (various nurses and physiotherapists). Serious thoracic
              patents are collected in this acute care facility. The nature of
              acute care starts with a patient very much unable to do more than
              press a button to ask for help and if all goes well, it ends with
              someone well enough to manage for himself. Each day began with
              an early chest X-ray once I could stand. I wore elastic sox designed
              to help people with phlebitis. An automatic pump massaged my lower
              legs with inflatable leggings to prevent clots. I learned far more
              about heart and pulmonary monitors than I ever wanted learn. &quot;Smoke
              (black wire) above fire (red wire) far from the snow (white wire
              on right side)&quot;. I became a fairly pleasant patient and I
              found that I was being used as &quot;a live crash dummy&quot; by
              nursing students (under the closest care of a supervising nurse).
              I actually looked forward to chatting with the nursing students
              and wishing them well in their studies. </p>
            <p>Mornings began with a very early visit by Dr. Gaissert. Carolee
              was amazed how early (by 6 AM) she had to come to meet him. Having
              him there to discuss the latest results did a huge amount to bolster
              my confidence that I was indeed mending very well. Shortly after
              he came, Dr. Cacciatola would arrive with first year residents
              in tow. He was always asking probing questions to make sure that
              I was comfortable, and about each and every feeling or symptom.
              Later pain specialists made sure I was in no pain. [I had low level
              pain sometimes, but almost nothing like I expected] . </p>
            <p>Most people got breakfast next but I had an NBM (nothing by mouth)
              sign on my chart until the fifth day. Physical therapy came next,
              and this was the territory of my grim hard core to push myself.
              Actually, I had the nurses and physiotherapists upset - I was too
              aggressive. Usually they have troubles getting someone to do anything.
              I was supposed to sit up the first day, but I got myself up and
              started marching down the corridor (too fast). Finally I was told
              that exercise was great but busting a gut [a very real possibility]
              was moronic. I slowed down a bit but made the walks longer. I learned
              a lot. I made rapid progress. <em class="red">I wasn't
              to learn until weeks later that I was burning up the physical fitness
              that I had built into my body over many years at the YMCA pool
              and exercise rooms. Eventually the spare stamina ran out and it
              was a few weeks before a compromise could be forged between the
              body (<strong>I'm really hurting and exhausted.)</strong>  and necessity <strong>(So
              what? Move it, now!)</strong>  Once I was chemotherapy and radiation
              I wish I had used up less earlier. I exhausted my reserves too
              soon. Later when starvation was a problem, the reserves were gone.</em></p>
            <p>My first bed was literally falling apart. One night several parts
              fell off next to the controls including the side rail. A guy from
              maintenance said the &quot;bed could short out&quot; and begin
              to move up and down on its own. In fact he was wrong the bed's
              controls are pneumatic and are failed safe. But to a heavily sedated
              patient, it seemed plausible. I sat up much of the night in a chair
              and was exhausted by the time Carolee came in. Carolee raised the
              roof and pretty soon, the &quot;broken bed incident&quot; got escalated
              more than it was worth. I am grateful to the MGH social councilor
              who listened to my tale. In hind sight, this is the one item where
              my sensible hard core didn't emerge when perhaps it should have.
              Too much happened and I was finally unable to maintain composure. </p>
            <p>Aside from the bed, the only complaint I had was eating. Most
              of the time I was fed simply by machine. For some reason, my extremely
              simple meals (colored flavored ices, clear fruit juice or broth)
              seemed beyond the MGH kitchen's ability to produce. I sometimes
              got breakfast as late as the afternoon and supper as late as 9:30
              when everyone else got meals on time. Since I looked forward to
              eating with my visitors (they bringing up a tray), it was really
              a bummer. Worse yet, I needed practice eating because my swallowing
              is anything but automatic. </p>
            <p>I could measure my progress by the tubes, wires, monitors, pumps
              and various prosthetic devices that were removed. Early removals
              were the direct blood pressure monitor (in a vein), then several
              heart medications (preventing arythymias) were dropped, the epidural
              tubes came next to be replaced by a pump that allowed me to self
              medicate pain relievers. Eventually the dreaded nose tube came
              out and I stopped sounding like Donald Duck. I was allowed to move
              about without having the heart and lung monitors attached (although
              they were back on when I was in bed). The drain in my neck stayed
              until the end. It was very annoying because it wouldn't stay put. </p>
            <p>As a slightly amusing anecdote, one morning near the end I knew
              that I was scheduled to have a variety of tubes and wires removed.
              As always critical patients come first and while the nurses were
              always caring and helpful, I was the healthiest critter they had
              so I came last when there was a conflict. I finally decided to
              removed some of the intravenous tubes, tape, and electrical connectors
              from my body. Dr. Gaissert came in and asked what I was doing.
              I gave him a grin and said &quot;I'm making a break for it Doc.
              Give me a head start of 15 feet past the nursing station and they
              will never catch me.&quot; He grinned back and said &quot;I'll
              help you with a disguise. They'll never recognize you without that
              tube in your nose. Stand up and take it like a man!&quot; He whipped
              the nose tube and its tape in one single deft motion and I was
              ready to make my break. </p>
            <p>I was off oxygen for a while but had to go back on it after I
              had a problem during my &quot;barium swallow&quot; on the 6th day.
              I aspirated about 30 cc of some testing liquid into my left lung
              while on the fluoroscope. I surprised the radiologists examining
              me when I simply cleared my lungs using the &quot;breathing and
              coughing&quot; exercises I had been taught. I calmly asked for
              more fluid and continued. Back in Thoracic Park, the male nurses
              took turns pummeling my back until everything had cleared. They
              used oxygen and a kind of a vaporizer to loosen my lungs. A de-aspirator
              tube was used to clear mucus and phlegm where I couldn't clear
              it by myself. In spite of my near disaster (I could have been Code
              Blue and in Emergency easily) I managed to pass the test handily. </p>
            <p>Carolee stayed at Beacon Hill House most nights while I was ill.
              On the last night Kevin and Carolee stayed at the same hotel to
              avoid problems with suitcases and bags. </p>
            <p><img src="/sto/lcoleman.gif" alt="Tumor Diagram" width="380" height="280" hspace="5" border="0" align="right">On the
              day before I left I had a series of consultations at MGH with Dr.
              Jeremy Abramson (radiation) assisted by his resident Dr. Ronald
              Chen and Dr. Panos Fidias (chemotherapy). They offered to help
              either by setting up a treatment at MGH or working with Rhode Island
              doctors if I felt like going that way. </p>
            <p>They described the tumor in more detail than I had seen before.
              The tumor had not managed to even invade the outer wall of the
              esophagus being constrained mainly to the mucous layer and adjoining
              the muscle. <strong>One</strong>  node was found to have microscopic traces
              of carcinoma. So immediately I went from being <strong>T1N0M0 (pure
              Stage 1)</strong>  to <strong>T1N1M0 (early Stage IIb)</strong> . No cancer has
              been found at either the upper end of the esophagus nor anywhere
              in the removed portion of the stomach. This has been confirmed
              by pathology under the microscope. Dr. Gaissert could not detect
              any spread of cancer to the nodes visually, but only pathology
              can really tell. After surgery I am assumed to be <strong>T1N1M0</strong>  (requiring
              chemo and radiation for a cure). I may be T0N0M0 (ie free of cancer)
              but we can't assume this. </p>
            <p><strong>September 13</strong>  Going home! In spite of savage bruises on
              my arms after a week of heparin injections, various intravenous
              injections, numerous blood test and allergic reactions to adhesive
              tape, I feel elated. </p>
            <p>My brother Dennis brought his Suburban up from Old Lyme CT to
              MGH to cart me, my stuff, and the three of us (Kevin, Carolee and
              myself) to Westerly. I was up early and the very last of the drains
              was removed. I had the first true shower since the beginning. With
              the exception of the J-tube, I was free of tape and tubes at last.
              I dressed in real clothes and by the time Dennis arrived I looked
              more than half human. I felt great but I was to learn how little
              real stamina I had by late afternoon. </p>
            <p>I was told to cut the two hour trip into two sections. I was no
              longer receiving heparin intra muscular shots every six hours and
              blood clots might yet form, so I had to walk around every hour
              of the trip. Dennis stopped, somewhere in darkest Woonsocket. I
              strode off toward a sign in the road, and three quarters of the
              way there the last of my reserves suddenly began to give way. I
              made it back to the Chevy but I was exhausted. I remember little
              of the remainder of the trip. At home, I focused on climbing the
              stairs and I fell into the guest room bed and was asleep within
              minutes. I was vaguely aware that something had been left in the
              Chevy, and that Dennis came back to deliver it, but I didn't really
              come to until evening. I was so disappointed with my performance
              but I have come to realize that stamina is no longer my middle
              name. </p>
            <p><strong>September 14</strong>  Carolee and Kevin went out and bought all
              sorts of sick room and soft foods for me. I have a sitty-downy
              ring (my posterior maximus is at best a posterior minimus now).
              A bed wedge allows me to sleep at a safe 30 degree angle (to avoid
              midnight saliva gagging). For a while the guest room will be my
              bedroom. A nurse, Holli Simmons, from the Coram Corporation brought
              a pump, Jevity, an elevated pole and explained how to feed myself
              by machine. It is basically the same setup as the hospital except
              that it is battery powered for up to 10 hours if need be. Since
              I am not on continuous feed, for the most part I simply wait until
              I can disconnect before doing much more than moving about the guest
              room, kitchen and bathroom. </p>
            <p><strong>September 15 to October 1</strong>  Each day is much like the prior.
              Dr. Gaissert is weaning me from the feeding tube. I started at
              2000 calories every third day with 1750 every two out three days.
              After 5 days, I dropped to 1000 calories. A week later I was down
              to 750 calories for four days then 500 calories a day for four
              days before stopping altogether in October. </p>
            <p>I have telephone consultations at least every with Dr. Gaissert
              in which he slowly allows me to do more and more. I am able to
              do more and more for myself. During this time I returned to the
              YMCA and actually was able to do dome aerobic cycling, treadmills
              and (light) weight machines. The showers at the YMCA are much better
              than at home. Guys at the YMCA are encouraging and say I look very
              well. <em class="red"> As chemo and radiation hit
              and worst off all dumping/diarrhea hit, I began to lose this appearance
              of wellness. Eventually even trips to the YMCA became rare until
              six weeks after treatments.</em></p>
            <p>My downstairs guest room bedroom is practical but I do feel like
              I am in Coventry. I can get up from the bed at night and wheel
              the food pump tube into the bathroom. However I really want to
              snuggle up to Carolee especially when the temperature drops. Sleeping
              on my back is getting better but I still wish I could turn over
              on my side for at least a few minutes. However this would mean
              tangling my food pump tubes and lying on the J-tube valve. <em class="red">When
              the J-tube was removed and after my abdominal muscles healed, I
              once again could sleep on my side.</em></p>
            <p>One of the really annoying problems is my J-tube. It pokes me
              and leaves painful red areas. Trying to attach it without discomfort
              is impossible. While I try to &quot;pad&quot; my tummy from the
              knobs on the end of the tube, it really isn't successful. I am
              very sensitive to adhesive tape. Leaving it in one area causes
              big red welts. When I shower, I must change everything. I need
              to take medicines and food by the J-tube, and everything has to
              be cleaned over and over again. </p>
            <p>The end of the J-tube ends in a dingus called a Lopez valve. It
              is both a very sensible idea and a a dumb idea rolled into one.
              It allows multiple uses of the J-tube without replugging (sensible),
              but it just won't stay in place and has sharp corners which gouge
              me (dumb). It must be taped away from the body, but adhesive tape
              simply isn't strong enough. Finally Carolee suggested that perhaps
              MoleSkin would work. It does, but I have to tape it over gauze
              to avoids welts. I actually got so annoyed that I wrote to the
              company which produces the Lopez valve and suggested then come
              up with a Lopez Valve case which would allow the unit to have no
              poking knobs and would attach via an elastic belt rather than adhesive
              tape. </p>
            <p>Hooking up to the food pump at night isn't too much of a hassle.
              It starts with me flushing the J-tube with 60-100 milliliters of
              spring water. I don't require sterility but I must have cleanliness.
              Medicines and vitamins are ground up, dissolved and injected through
              the medication port on the Lopez valve. More water is flushed in
              and then I pour cans of Jevity (which smells like baby colic) into
              a fresh feeding bag. I hook the bag onto the machine pole, pre
              pump the air out of the tubes, insert the pentagonal pumping wedge
              into the machine, connect the thin feeding funnel into the Lopez
              valve. If I do everything right, I then turn on the Lopez valve,
              the pump and away I go. If I goof, either the pump begins to beep
              or worse yet if I forget to open all the valves and doohickies
              in the right order, gooey Jevity squirts onto my clothes. </p>
            <p>I optionally take pain killers. I am weaning myself from the strongest
              (OxyCodone) to the mildest (Advil). I am actually afraid of OxyCodone
              (a drug of which OxyContin is a form). My IQ drops when I take
              it and I simply don't consider things that turn out to be dangerous.
              For example Carolee was rightfully terrified when she discovered
              I was moving cases of Jevity food when 5 pounds was my maximal
              safe weight lifting limit. A step down in power, and somewhat less
              stupefying, is Codeine Phosphate. After the very beginning, I found
              that Codeine was the maximum power I needed. I tried to get off
              this stuff too soon, but I only had to go back once in a while.
              Advil works quite well and has no problems of me acting stupid.
              By the end of September I was off all these drugs permanently. </p>
            <p><strong>October 2</strong>  Carolee and I got lost trying to find Rhode Island
              Hospital [RIH]. She found driving in Providence nerve wracking.
              Hopefully I will be able to do most if not all the remaining driving. </p>
            <p>We made our first visit with Dr. DiPetrillo, who has come well
              recommended by both Dr. Knisley and Dr. Gaissert. I was frankly
              skeptical of what use radiation would be in a case like mine, and
              not at all happy with the idea of radiation near a very tender
              anastimosis (joining of unlike tissues) in my throat. Dr. DiPetrillo
              explained that there were two tubular columns that were on either
              side of the spine that used to run along the esophagus. These contain
              the lymph nodes that were most likely to harbor any escaped cancer
              cells. </p>
            <p>Radiation is going to be a bitch. I am having considerable problems
              eating currently. I vomit and gag with almost no provocation. I
              get diarrhea at the drop of a hat. I still can't eat more than
              1500 calories or so on a normal day. Yet much as I don't want to
              do it, the doctors have convinced me that my best interest are
              to radiate. So I will.<strong> </strong>  </p>
            <p><strong>October 6</strong>  We had a follow up session with Dr. Knisley.
              He had not received the surgical, pathology or consultation reports
              yet, after his vacation. [A day later he called to say they had
              unearthed themselves from someone's desk.] Dr. Knisley remarked
              how well I looked exactly a month after surgery. I am still not
              sure exactly what type of chemotherapy if any I will undergo. I
              discussed the drawbacks of some drugs like Cisplaten (hearing loss). </p>
            <p><strong>October 9</strong>  We made a trip to Boston MGH to have the first
              of our follow up visits with Dr. Gaissert. Carolee was nonplused
              to discover the train station closed to ticket buyers earlier in
              the week, but we got them the day before. </p>
            <p>Our first trip was to Wang Outpatient X-ray. I carried the photos
              to my meeting with Dr. Gaissert who removed the J-tube much to
              my relief. He made sure that I understood that having to reinsert
              one later would involve considerable extra difficulty. If the problem
              is only for a few days near the end of radiation and/or chemotherapy,
              I do not see worrying about it. [This turned out to be much too
              optimistic.] If I really need massive food by tube for many days,
              then an operation to install another tube will be the least of
              my problems. I have been given permission to eat anything, to exercise
              (except for sit-ups and crunches for another month) and to generally
              administer my own recovery. We discussed the problem I am having
              with my throat constricting, vomiting and generally having eating
              problems. Dr. Gaissert still feels that with time these problems
              will recede. </p>
            <p>We had a long wait (most of it at South Station) for a train home.
              It was exhausting. </p>
            <p><strong>October 15</strong>  Carolee and I drive to RIH for the preparation
              for the start of radiation on Monday. I was taken to a CT Scan
              room and told that basically two things would happen - a form fitting &quot;pillow&quot; of
              semi-hard foam would be made of my head, shoulders and arms (held
              above my head) and that I would be tattooed (three small dots)
              on my chest and under my arms. It was relatively quick and except
              for an uncomfortable tugging at the bottom of my rib cage quite
              painless. It took perhaps 15 minutes, most of it flat on my back
              and unable to move except to breath. </p>
            <p><strong>October 16</strong>  I had a session (private lesson) with Carolee's
              Yoga teacher - Anita. The purpose of this in my mind was three
              fold: improve my breathing and pain control, retain and if possible
              improve range of motion and if it is the case find a way to lie
              flat on my back with my arms above my head without strange tugging
              pain at the bottom of my ribcage. </p>
            <p>In the afternoon (2:15) Carolee and I had a session with Dr. Knisley.
              It started as with all such session with the weekly blood test
              (good). Dr. Knisley is getting a bit concerned about the weight
              loss. It isn't that 178 pounds is so bad but that I still have
              potentially the worst weight loss ahead of me. Dr. Knisley introduced
              me to Dr. Lagare his partner. Doctors Gaissert, DiPetrillo, Knisley
              and Lagare have been discussing chemotherapy for me. They have
              taken my concerns about Cisplatin and Carboplatin (additional crucial
              hearing loss) to heart. My chemotherapy will be 5FU (Fluorouricil)
              carried by Leucovorin. I will get two hours of Leucovorin and during
              this time I will get 450 units of 5FU. </p>
            <p>We were introduced to the nurse Angela who runs the center where
              the actual chemicals are delivered. We also met Dawn who is my
              phlebotamist. She gave me some samples of Boost. Some sort of caloric
              supplement will be part of my life from now to the end of chemo
              (at least). I will go every Tuesday at 9-11. Chemotherapy will
              last at least as long as radiation and may continue for as long
              as 6 months. The day before I will have blood work done by Dawn
              to speed up my ability to get to RIH on time. </p>
            <p><strong>October 20</strong>  Today was supposed to be the start of radiation
              treatment, but wires got crossed and it wasn't scheduled until
              Wednesday. My appointments will be at 12:40 every weekday - the
              only available time between 10 and 2. The radiation will continue
              for 5 to 6 weeks. We want to avoid rush hour traffic in cases where
              Carolee has to drive. We also wish to avoid impact to YMCA time
              etc. </p>
            <p>In the afternoon the technician called delaying the start for
              a day. The &quot;digital map&quot; of what they want to do to my
              body isn't ready. The first two or three sessions will be with
              a low intensity beam (basically an X-ray) that they will use for
              calibration. </p>
            <p>I still had to go to Dr. Knisley's phlobotamist Dawn for blood
              work a day ahead of treatment. </p>
            <p><strong>October 21</strong>  I started chemotherapy today. Dr. Knisley's
              office contains a chemotherapy room with hospital like isolation
              curtains. The chairs are comfortable recliners. Angela (the nurse)
              inserts an IV needle into my arm and begins a saline drip. After
              a while Leucovorin (a Folic Acid [B vitamin] look alike) is introduced
              into the IV bag. The more powerful 5FU (fluorouricil) is added
              through a port. It gives me a flush sensation. I will have to be
              careful that its most notorious side effect - diarrhea - doesn't
              overwhelm me. The first session took 2 hours and 40 minutes but
              Angela promises that the remaining sessions will only take two
              hours giving me time to get to Radiation at RIH. </p>
            <p><strong>October 22</strong>  I awoke about 1:45 AM with fairly heavy reflux.
              By 5:45 AM I found it very difficult to drink even a single can
              of Boost. I swam five laps and suddenly had to stop with severe
              diarrhea. By the time I got home, I was totally exhausted. I slept
              from 8:30 AM until 11:15 AM. </p>
            <p><strong>October 23 </strong>  We arrived early at the hospital but there
              was a long delay. After checking and being told I would be next,
              a technician came out and said that I would not be next because
              the doctors were still working on the digital map but that it would
              be soon. Soon was not really too long, about another 15 minutes
              or roughly a delay of an hour in total. </p>
            <p>I was placed on an X-ray machine which look like a box connected
              to a wide semicircular arm ending in a head about half a meter
              across. The whole rigmarole spins about you in a semicircle. After
              making the calibration runs and conferring with the doctors behind
              the radiation screening, the technicians said they had a good lock
              on me and asked if I was ready for a real dose. I said yes. The
              machine clicked, whirred and rotated about me but otherwise I could
              not see or feel anything. I saw the screening mechanism changed
              the pattern by sliding thin metal strips in and out until the right
              shape mask was created. </p>
            <p><strong>October 27</strong>  I saw both Dr. DiPetrillo and Dr. Knisley and
              discussed my problems with diarrhea and vomiting that seems to
              have lead to weakness and exhaustion. In fact my problem seems
              to be <strong>low blood pressure!</strong>  My pressure has dropped to <strong>86/60</strong> .
              As Dr. Knisley says high blood pressure is one thing but you can't
              live with no blood pressure. I am off most of my medications. The
              Hydrochlorothiazide and the Norvasc have been dropped entirely.
              The Lisinopril and Metoprolol Tartrate remain but at a single dose
              a day. My weakness is from low potassium in spite of taking 550
              mg per day. </p>
            <p>I've begun to eat a little better. I have eaten sizable portions
              of chicken and chicken salad. I have tried ProSure - a fish based
              high protein drink. I literally have to hold my nose to gag it
              down. </p>
            <p><strong>October 30</strong>  This was a really poor day. It started all right
              but once diarrhea hit with a vengeance I lost stamina and was dizzy
              most of the day. I went to the Y, but felt exhausted by the time
              I got home. For the most part eating was OK, but my session with
              radiation at RIH was nearly a wipeout. I needed help to keep from
              wobbling and perhaps falling, in the hospital and heading back
              to the car. On the way home, I had to pull over at exit 7 and turn
              the car over to Carolee. I actually phased out between exits 6
              and 3. In spite of naps before and after the RIH trip, I feel really
              pretty punk. I need to get some sort of blood pressure gauge. <strong>Hyper</strong> tension
              is the silent killer but <strong>hypo</strong> tension can kill you just as
              quickly - just pass out on I-95. </p>
            <p><strong>October 31</strong>  I started the day by visiting the eye doctor
              to pick up my new glasses, and to recovery my tailbone cushion
              which I had left at Dr. Knisley's office. On the way home I checked
              my blood pressure at CVS which is now a relatively decent 118/70
              after four days of lowered blood pressure medications. </p>
            <p>Carolee and I met with Karen Pasquaini, RIH's Senior Dietitian.
              Karen used to work with Dr. Gaissert while he was the EC surgeon
              at RIH. She has some practical ideas for stopping the &quot;dumping&quot; syndrome
              which is plaguing me. It seems likely that the diarrhea isn't true
              diarrhea but a condition where the body tries to dump water to
              dilute sugary or starchy foods. Even when I eat protein meals I
              have been drinking fruit juice which probably triggers the reaction.
              Milk isn't much better - it is common for EC patients to develop
              lactose intolerance. I have to eat protein at every meal along
              with normal foods. </p>
            <p>Well of all the hobgoblins bedeviling me, none is worse than the
              plethora of foul concoctions that the medical/industrial complex
              is trying to foist on patients. The current leader of the pack
              is Deliver-2.0. The dietitian says it is so bad that trying to
              drink one can of this at a sitting is impossible. Yup! True! Its
              awful! It purports to taste like vanilla. Well Vanilla flavored
              what? Road tar? I am in no position to judge. I'll simply say,
              it won't make the flavor of the month. </p>
            <p><strong>November 1</strong>  I slept very poorly last night for no particular
              reason. I didn't even try to go to bed until nearly 11 PM and didn't
              get to sleep for over an hour. I was awake by 4:45. I did get back
              into bed after AM and slept for a bit over an hour. All day today
              has been a poor eating day. While the dumping syndrome seems to
              have subsided, swallowing without gagging is nearly impossible. </p>
            <p>As Carolee keeps saying, it is so hard to keep all the balls in
              the air at one time. I need to eat as close to 2200-2300 calories
              as possible to have full vitality (1500 calories are required to
              avoid weight loss for total bedridden patients). However my stomach
              won't allow that much food in a day unless it is loaded with sugar
              and fats. If I eat sugar and fats then I trigger the dumping syndrome
              and lose the calories and minerals in spite of myself as diarrhea.
              If I try to eat I diet high in protein (wonderful in terms of bodily
              health and suppression of dumping) I run into the mechanical problem
              that I simply can't stuff more than about 1100-1200 calories of
              protein in per day. Protein is simply too dense and my stomach
              is too small. I'm swallow high calorie, high protein supplements
              but they really trigger the gagging reflex. I used to walk on a
              high plateau. On one side was anorexia but I never got close enough
              to see the edge. Other edges had problems like obesity, bloating
              and cholesterol. With EC, the once spacious plateau has become
              a narrow route along a mountain ridge. Gaps appear where only a
              jump across allows me to progress. The abyss of anorexia is all
              too evident. If I avoid that area, I still have the problems of
              eating. </p>
            <p><strong>November 3</strong>  Every Monday is &quot;Doctor Day&quot; when
                I meet with both Dr. DiPetrillo and Dr. Knisley. Today was an
                absolute winner. In a nearly perfect reversal of last Monday
                (October 27th), </p>
            <ul>
              <li>I seem to have kept &quot;dumping&quot; under control </li>
              <li>I'm eating a more normal diet with more real foods, especially
                    meat </li>
              <li>My blood pressure is normal 118/68 with 1/3 of the prior drugs </li>
              <li>My weight has <strong>increased</strong>  to 175 </li>
              <li>I feel comparatively full of energy. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both doctors were very pleased, needless to say and Carolee and
              I feel justly happy with the results. I'll look at the blood tests
              tomorrow, but good, bad or simple OK, it won't ruin a good day
              today. </p>
            <p><strong>November 4</strong>  C'est La Vie! My left foot feels very odd today.
              Actually I noticed a few twinges yesterday but the foot feels much
              stranger today. It has feeling and it obeys commands to walk but
              there almost seems to be a half second delay between the thought
              and the action. The top of the foot has an odd padded feel when
              I touch it. If I use a pencil to touch it, the sensation seems
              more &quot;immediate&quot;. I called Dr. Knisley and told him the
              symptoms. I said I was told to call if any odd problems occurred
              and he agreed but he has no idea at all what if anything this might
              be. I will go in tomorrow if things get worse. If they get really
              bad I will go into the emergency room tonight. </p>
            <p>When I got home after radiation, I couldn't eat a Pot Pie. Any
              attempt to eat or even drink water brought on vomiting. However
              things were OK prior to chemo and radiation this morning. I attempted
              the standard trick of waiting things out but it is a false hope.
              I can't even keep down pure water much less food. Strangely I don't
              feel bad actually eating the stuff but shortly after that my stomach
              begins to knot and heave violently. By 7:15 PM I have just begun
              to be able to keep mouthfuls of cold water down. While eating for
              today is a disaster, maybe I can hydrate myself through the evening. </p>
            <p>I had to sleep for a substantial part of the afternoon. In spite
              of a reasonable room warmth (middle sixties) and the fact I am
              wearing my FDO &quot;monogrammed&quot; warming shirt over a standard
              long sleeve shirt, I was cold. I just cannot have too many good
              days without something new and odd. <strong>Nertz! Rats-a-frast! May
              the fleas of a thousand diseased camels infest the navel of esophageal
              cancer and associated radiation and chemo therapies!!!! May it
              live in interesting times in the company of congress critters!!! </strong>  </p>
            <p><strong>November 5</strong>  The day started off like yesterday ended with
              dry heave vomiting even with nothing to trigger it. I have been
              able to sip little bits of water and in one of the sips I managed
              to swallow dissolved pills and vitamins. I called Dr. Knisley's
              office for anti-vomiting medicine. I will be taking Prochlorperazine
              to calm my nausea. In its first outing it seems to have done the
              job. Shortly after taking it I was able to keep down 4 ounces of
              Lactaid (a lactose free milk). About an hour later I was able to
              eat a portion of applesauce. </p>
            <p>When I got home after radiation, I was so tired I simply had to
              take an immediate hour and a half nap. I drank 3 ounces of the
              dreaded Deliver goo. I have learned for the first time the meaning
              of &quot;Stand and deliver!&quot;. No wonder so many waylaid travelers
              chose to fight their way out instead. </p>
            <p><strong>November 6</strong>  I tried a new product called Support. It has
              more protein than Deliver but fewer calories (470:360). The first &quot;box&quot; went
              fine, but then I tried a second box a few hours later and triggered
              a major &quot;dumping&quot; session. I had to pull off the road
              to use a bathroom on the way up to my radiation session. I just
              can't seem to keep all the ball in the air at the same time. </p>
            <p><strong>November 7</strong>  After a couple of high readings at the CVS blood
              pressure machine, we decided to buy our own machine. I will have
              to tell Dr. Knisley that I have partially returned to the blood
              pressure medications because my pressure is between 150/95 and
              165/104 variously. Just what we needed, yet another added complication.
              I really need to talk with Dr. Lentz about adjusting the medications. </p>
            <p><strong>November 8</strong>  This day was a disaster food wise. Almost everything
              I took in ended up lost through vomiting. My weight overnight dropped
              a record 3.2 pounds although I really think some of that was simply
              dehydration. My blood pressure is high and my pulse rate is high.
              On the positive side, I managed to do a hour of heavy work in the
              garden, cutting down the entire north forty, the hostas along the
              road, and most of the beds outside the wall. I ended up with five
              large wheelbarrow loads of stuff for the compost heap. I was tired
              but I wasn't faint. </p>
            <p><strong>November 10</strong>  What an exhausting day. The day started with
              the landscaper we hired arriving a bit late to pick up the leaves.
              The drive to Providence was bad, and then everything got delayed.
              I didn't get in to the X-ray machine until late and my session
              with Dr. DiPetrillo was late. I reported my &quot;clown feet&quot; syndrome,
              my weight loss and my inability to eat. After this session he called
              DR. Knisley. The drive to Dr. Knisley's office resulted in my third
              turn over of the car to Carolee at exit 7. This session ran slow
              as well. I had a bout of diarrhea but was able to use his facilities
              in time. I was actually prone on the examination bench when Dr.
              Knisley came in, I was so tired. When we arrived home the landscapers
              still had not finished. </p>
            <p><strong>November 11</strong>  Well I am back to my naval weight of 165 -
              down 40 pounds from the start of this diary when I arrived home
              (actually 53 pounds from my all time heaviest). I should be reaching
              my &quot;ideal&quot; weight where my weight loss slows to a trickle.
              We'll see since I am still having eating problems. I am weak and
              very tired almost all the time now. I hope this chemo/radiation
              really works. I guess I'll settle for no sign of disease for half
              a decade as proof even though they may be blasting a non-entity.
              At least I have a one day delay from chemo due to Veteran's Day.
              This day actually went quite well. Although I went to bed early
              (8:45) in spite of an afternoon hour nap, I felt better and had
              energy. </p>
            <p><strong>November 12</strong>  Hopefully I am &quot;on a new plateau&quot; since
              my weight bounced up a bit. Very rough day. Chemo was slow and
              radiation was late. I was too tired to drive home. Managed to choke
              down only 900 calories. I spent the afternoon sleeping. The shipment
              of food supplements has come from Walgreens'. </p>
            <p><strong>November 13</strong>  I feel really punk on awakening. My weight
              seems to be holding. I came across information suggesting &quot;clown
              foot&quot; or &quot;drop foot&quot; may indicate a need for extra
              Vitamin B12. I can no longer &quot;snap&quot; my right toes or
              pick up pencils. </p>
            <p><strong>November 25</strong>  The last day of the initial session of chemo
              therapy. I'll be on 6 on/3 off weeks starting in December. I need
              the time off for feeding. I am eating only handfuls. </p>
            <p><strong>November 26</strong>  I saw Dr. Jon Solis my dermatologist. 5FlouroUracil
              has eliminated this seasons crop of keratoses. One small side advantage
              to stack up against a host of bad side effects. </p>
            <p><strong>November 27 Thanksgiving</strong>  Today was the pits. Carolee made
              a tiny Thanksgiving meal which she ate and which I picked at. Next
              Wednesday is the end of radiation. I hope I can come back in weight.
              I'm down to 161.8. I have been eating less than 1000 calories a
              day for most of the last eight days. </p>
            <p><strong>November 29</strong>  Kevin and Mary arrived for a visit on their
              way home after they had Thanksgiving at her folks. It was very
              nice to see them. We had dinner at Shelter Harbor Inn. I actually
              ate most of a bowl of Crab/Corn Chowder. No incidents. I also ate
              lots of Belgian Chocolate without dumping. Only three days to go
              in Providence. I am getting very tired of these trips. </p>
            <p><strong>December 1</strong>  Today's session at RIH was as close to a fiasco
              as possible without a true disaster. We got there on time and the
              backup didn't seem that great but I never was called. We asked
              and we were told that we were next plus one after it was longer
              than usual for my turn. Then we were told that it would be a bit
              longer perhaps 5 minutes which turned into a quarter hour and several
              others went ahead of me. Carolee went to find out what was going
              on. It seems that they were about to start a third phase of treatment
              which required new X-rays. However my chart was &quot;lost&quot;.
              So we were waiting on the AWOL charts. </p>
            <p>Finally we got the charts and I went in for a very long sessions
              of X-ray pictures and unknown to me no treatment today meaning
              that they were pushing the completion date back another day. Carolee
              and I made it very clear that we didn't think much of the idea
              of skipping a day of treatment when it meant yet another days travel
              to Providence. They didn't even ask me what I preferred. </p>
            <p>I asked three questions of Dr. John Purviance who was sitting
              in for Dr. DiPatrillo (1) What % of the lifetime radiation have
              I taken - roughly 70%. A normal X-ray adds 1/10 of one percent.
              The area of major effect is the spine. (2) Will there be a post
              treatment follow up visit. Yes, about one month later. (3) I asked
              what if any symptoms I should be alert to report. Primarily additional
              difficulty swallowing. This includes painful symptoms, and any
              sense of mechanical problems. My upper bowels presumably have a
              still intact adequate blood supply so damage from radiation should
              be minimal. </p>
            <p>The drive home very late into the teeth of the Sun was very stressful. </p>
            <p><strong>December 2</strong>  Today we reached total fiasco, both X-ray machines
              broke down completely. My machine had a software hang-up in communications.
              The other machine broke a gear. They sent the other side people
              home but we waited until we gave up. I've made an appointment for
              Thursday afternoon, hoping to get a session in. I will call as
              we get close to each day's session. </p>
            <p>One encouraging thing, I actually felt something akin to hunger
              this evening. I went into the fridge and &quot;snitched&quot; ice
              cream. It was my first even vague desire for food. Everything else
              has been duty and time. </p>
            <p><strong>December 4</strong>  I had my doctors' meetings with Dr. Knisley
              and Dr. Lentz today. Both went well. Much of the Dr. Knisley meeting
              was a standard rehash of the fact that I am doing very well. We
              discussed the fact that I will be getting CT scans at fairly frequent
              intervals stretched out after several years. The very fact that
              he is talking about what and how many tests I will have five years
              down the pike is encouraging. He was also pleased to see me eating
              a pudding when he came in. . </p>
            <p>Dr. Lentz was catching up with a half year of EC changes in me.
              We spent most of the time talking about the blood pressure. I am
              to avoid pressures above 160/105 and pulse rates above 110. I can
              take metoprolol half doses up to twice a day to keep things in
              check but I absolutely should stay away from hydroclorothiazide.
              I may or may not cut back on potassium </p>
            <p><strong>December 5</strong>  This is the true last day of radiation if all
              goes well. We switched the appointment to 11 because a huge winter
              storm is due in this afternoon and evening with snow amounts measured
              at 10 inches and above. We are expected to get a period of sleet
              or freezing rain at the coast before the really cold air settles
              in. Joy. </p>
            <p><strong>December 9</strong>  The last radiation set which was aimed directly
              at the area of the tumor has done a real job on me. Each day for
              the last several, the pain has increased. Today while Tim visited
              it reached the point that I had to take codeine to keep the pain
              low enough to let me sleep. I believe the bowel is inflamed where
              the tumor used to be. When I take something soothing, the pain
              goes away as soon as the area is coated. Pain goes away and then
              returns as the coating wears away to be finally held at bay for
              hours by the medication. </p>
            <p><strong>December 10</strong>  We are headed to Boston on the train for an
              overnight visit to Dr. Gaissert at MGH. We decided not to visit
              him at Newton/Wellesley hospital because of the six hour long drive
              up and back. Frankly I'm not sure I could go six hours by car without
              staying over. So Boston by the train seems best. We'll stay at
              the Holiday Inn next to MGH. </p>
            <p>I wish the pain in my belly wasn't so painful. I'm losing weight
              gain. I've finally reached a loss of 50 pounds since I came back
              from the hospital (155). This is 10 pounds lower than I ever expected
              to fall. I'm not particularly weak but I have no stamina and I
              nap a lot. I have to control the weight loss and the radiation
              burns and maybe the chemo are no help. My desire for food which
              had returned has evaporated again. I am depressed. </p>
            <p>The train to Boston was delayed several hours, but a make-up train
              was created this side of NYC which cut the delay to about 1:40.
              While it was late, it really caused no problem thanks to the kindness
              of Bob in the AMTRAK office who called us to let us know the situation. </p>
            <p><strong>December 11</strong>  Our meeting with Dr. Gaissert was very pleasant
              as usual. Essentially while I can call on him at any time, I will
              be relying on Dr. Knisley from now on. I tried to eat as well as
              possible on the trip but I averaged only 1150 calories. Most of
              that was from a huge vanilla frappe I bought at Eat Street, MGH's
              large food court. </p>
            <p><strong>December 12</strong>  I swam again today for the first
              time in many weeks. I managed 1/3 mile (12 laps) before I decided
              discretion was the better part of valor. I did OK form wise but
              my speed was very slow. I won't time myself for weeks to come.
              Just swimming is enough. <em class="red">My assumption that I would
              get back to the YMCA soon proved very premature. I really didn't
              resume a full schedule until late spring 2004.</em></p>
            <p><strong>December 13</strong>  I made a determined push to load food in and
              managed to eat 1690 calories before my body wouldn't take anything
              else. I ate tuna casserole on rice for supper with Carolee. </p>
            <p><strong>December 15</strong>  This is the last day of experimentation before
              Chemo resumes tomorrow. I was able to eat a hard bun with lots
              of butter and jelly. I have had a set of major bowel movements
              which I hope do not lead to diarrhea. I am very unhappy about chemo
              starting up again. I make the best of it but I really hate being
              tied to a saline drip with chemicals. </p>
            <p>I've had a very strange gagging late in the afternoon. I could
              not keep down chicken and it went on and on with lots of mucous.
              I suspect my attempt to eat bread/jelly/butter was the cause. <em class="red">Although
              I did not know it until the summer of 2004, this gagging was the
              first sign that my anastimosis would require dialations. I spent
              several months trying to overcome the saliva/mucous problem with
              drugs before dilations cured me.</em></p>
            <p><strong>December 16</strong>  This was a long tiring shopping day at the
              Mall in New London. I had to spend much of it sitting. Standing
              in stores is double torture for me. I hate shopping and worse yet
              standing without walking causes me to feel faint. We managed to
              buy me some clothes that fit. Anything larger than a 34 waist just
              hangs in folds around me now, and before the operation 38 waists
              were getting tight. It took forever to find a belt because they
              were all mislabeled. Finally succeeded by measuring my belt against
              the store belts. I can wear 33 waists very comfortably and 32 waists
              are coming into range. </p>
            <p><strong>December 24</strong>  This is a very odd Christmas Eve since we haven't
              decorated or done very much. Carolee packed me off to the cinema
              to see &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. It is a very impressive
              version of the Tolkien classic, but it was a little strange to
              eat snacks out of baby food jars during the 3.5 hour film. </p>
            <p><strong>December 25</strong>  This is the least joyous Christmas I can remember.
              Even as an adult I woke early to turn on the tree and maybe play
              some carols. None of that this year - I slept until 8 AM, missing
              my 6 AM feeding entirely. We opened a few momentos after breakfast
              but otherwise it is has been a dreary day. I am very disappointed
              at my losing race to feed myself. This morning I inched closer
              to the 140s which I once thought were impossibly low. I see myself
              as something akin to a concentration camp survivor and something
              akin to an old man. I dress neatly everyday as much to hide how
              I look from myself as to be in style. </p>
            <p><strong>January 1</strong>  My weight has inched up over the last two days.
              I hope but don't really believe that I have finally reached the
              bottom of the weight cliff I have fallen off. I am eating nearly
              enough to maintain basal metabolism but little else. I am very
              tired all the time and weak. I have been going to the YMCA but
              my work output is 15 minutes on the bicycle or a third of a mile
              swimming. Both leave me very tired. </p>
            <p><strong>January 2</strong>  After successfully eating some of Carolee's steak
              dinner, my stomach went into rebellion this afternoon and night.
              It absolutely refused to take anything, even water without immediately
              vomiting it up. I became very thirsty (and I suspect somewhat dehydrated)
              but I could not keep even sips of water down throughout the afternoon
              and as late as 3 AM the next morning. However by 4 AM I finally
              got some water down. However the damage was done, my weight gain
              of the past several days is gone and I am down to 148 flat. I am
              very depressed about the setback but somewhat heartened that I
              will not have to go to the hospital to keep hydrated. I was only
              able to eat 1075 calories before the setback. </p>
            <p><strong>January 4</strong>  After an attempt to eat some salmon, I again
              had the problem of vomiting. I am beginning to suspect that certain
              dense foods form a &quot;ball&quot; which doesn't dissolve as rapidly
              as it should and block the exit from the stomach. I suspect that
              I am not producing enough stomach acid. Carolee has suggested that
              the last dose of radiation did some damage to the digestive track
              and that either it has slowed production of stomach acid or has
              closed the valve when dense foods are eaten. Both ideas seem plausible.
              We will discuss this with the doctors. </p>
            <p><strong>January 6</strong>  I talked with Dr. Knisley about my eating problems.
              He suggested that perhaps REGLAN would work. Carolee remembered
              that Dr. DiPetrillo had prescribed some which at the time did not
              seem to stop vomiting. However REGLAN is specific for opening the
              valve to the bowels. We are going to try it that way. </p>
            <p><strong>January 8/9 night</strong>  What should have been a triumph - I finally
              broke through for a major caloric day (1565 calories) became a
              real setback when at Carolee's prompting I tried for the gold ring
              by taking Support as my last &quot;meal&quot;. I reached the magical
              gain weight calorie level (actually <strong>1925</strong>  ) except that two
              hours after eating I awoke to major abdominal cramps. For two hours
              I was on and off again on the toilet with a major dumping session.
              The net of it was I lost weight, almost 3/4 of a pound. Hopefully
              most of it is water loss and I will regain some or all of it. I
              am now down below 147 for the first time. I also had major sleep
              problems. I was unable to sleep for 4 to 5 hours throughout the
              night and finally had to go down to the couch. </p>
            <p><strong>January 16</strong>  I have had a fairly successful week and more
              with higher average levels of calories and protein. That is not
              to say that I haven't had setbacks like experiments which have
              gone awry. For example, I tried turnip today. It was shredded and
              coated with butter and it might as well have been a Brillo pad.
              Even four hours later I cannot get down juice with my pills. I
              have been in the 146-148 range for two weeks. I hope I am bottoming
              out - I should be as I reach basal metabolism level but the extreme
              cold (subzero) works against me. </p>
            <p><strong>January 20 </strong>  For two days my belly has been upset. Yesterday
              and this morning I could not get anything, even water down and
              I lost two pounds. Since it was the day I get chemo, I knew I would
              see Dr. Knisley. Angela asked how I was and when I replied she
              said, &quot;No chemo yet, you need to have blood work and talk
              with the doctor.&quot; It seems the combination of 5FU and leucovorin
              has a common side effect of sores and a dry mouth. I don't have
              these symptoms but a parallel symptom is mucousivitis (upset mucous
              membranes) which I do have along with a generally irritable bowel.
              Upshot, no chemo but a liter of saline with potassium, as my treatment
              and I am off the treatment until I can recover. I am trying to
              eat to recover from this morning's problems. </p>
            <p><strong>January 22</strong>  I made a trip to see Dr. Knisley because the
              chemo induced mucousivitis has triggered gingivitus particularly
              in my right eye. Some drops from CVS fixed this problem but I am
              feeling run down. </p>
            <p><strong>January 23</strong>  Go team! Yeaahh! I finally broke the 2000 calories
              barrier and big time without dumping or secondary problems. 2100
              big calories and I didn't feel choked with food. I am still getting
              too much of my food from ice cream and I still can't manage fibrous
              foods (Can you say <strong>Beechnut</strong>  and <strong>Gerber</strong>  , boys and
              girls?) but at least the stuff can be bought on the regular aisles
              of a supermarket. Carolee wants me off ice cream soon but I need
              some type of concentrated caloric input and artificial foods wipe
              me out. </p>
            <p><strong>January 27</strong>  A less than great day but not horrible. I went
              out to the YMCA and the library but I slept a lot today. I could
              not keep oatmeal down and the rest of the day has been mediocre
              as an eating day. I am trying to get basal metabolic level calories
              in, but I'm still low at 7 PM. </p>
            <p><strong>February 2</strong>  This is a up beat day for me. The Patriots have
              won a squeaker, and I have managed to add a pound to my weight
              after the best eating day in five months. Best ever if you discount
              days on Jevity. Back to chemo in the morning. Ugh! </p>
            <p><strong>February 5</strong>  At my examination by Dr. Lentz, we dropped Norvasc
              from my drugs. </p>
            <p><strong>February 7</strong>  This was our first major outing since the operation.
              I went to my Aunt Joan's 75th birthday party. We stayed over at
              Moira's so that I could nap and sleep soon after the party. I doubt
              that I would have survived as well without a place to crash. My
              eating took a nose dive for two reasons - mucousavitis and irregular
              meals. I wish I could have eaten the shrimp that was served at
              the party but I didn't dare. </p>
            <p><strong>February 17</strong>  The chemo drugs are doing their side effect
              thingees on me for sure. I have intestinal aches and pains every
              day. And on the last few days I have had dumping again. A new and
              disturbing problem is &quot;eating nightmares&quot; which are dreams
              about being somewhere where I should be able to eat but find forces
              prevent me from doing it. Once I was in a company cafeteria where
              kids had been on a tour. By the time I got to the serving line
              everything edible was gone. Even the last crust of bread. Another
              dream was a large picnic where my meal was eaten when it was supposed
              to be kept for me while I tended cars. By the time I got there,
              it was raining and all the paper plates and cups were gone along
              with my food. These are becoming a nightly event. Sometimes they
              come several times in a single night. I wake up feeling horribly
              depressed and it is easy to see where the problem arises. </p>
            <p><strong>March 1-2</strong>  What a difference two days can make. Day 1 and
              I felt on top of the world. I ate up a storm and even managed to
              eat mixed nuts on top of a major meal including meat, veggies,
              ice cream, and tea. The next day after chemo, I suffered dumping
              badly. Sigh! </p>
            <p><strong>March 8-9</strong>  Chemo has really made life miserable. I have
              been sleeping it off as best I can but I feel really sick to my
              gut (not stomach anymore). The sensation is like cramps but quite
              deep. I have had a fair amount of dumping over these days. It was
              very hard to go ahead with this last dose of chemo when I was still
              feeling ill from last week's dose. I have reach an all time low
              weight since I was in grade school. I am now at <strong>140</strong>  pounds
              which is more than <strong>1/3</strong>  of my original
              body weight. </p>
            <p><strong>March 10</strong>  Carolee and I went to the seminar on Nutrition
              held by the ACS (Melissa Campbell) at Dr. Knisley's office. It
              was quite good although I was the only male in the group. I was
              sort of the prize guinea pig since everything that could happen
              in eating has happened to me except eating normally and gaining
              weight. Every side effect listed has happened to me, sometimes
              seriously like weight loss and inability to eat enough to regain
              weight. [Melissa sent me a cordial Thank You note for being so
              active.] I did get some useful information. &quot;Designer&quot; brand
              Whey is very much suggested as a protein source. Spagettios can
              be eaten whenever soft food can be tolerated. </p>
            <p><strong>March 15</strong>  We had planned to drive to Providence in the morning
              to get me a new suit. My only prior suits are now too large to
              wear and a couple of weeks ago I gave them to Blue Mitten. However,
              a storm is coming that makes this trip look like a very bad idea.
              Predictions vary from 2-3 inches of mostly ice to 10 inches of
              wet snow. Even if we make it in the store may be understaffed.
              It seems crazy after today which had me walking a mile to the end
              of Nichols Road in 55 degree weather. Figures! We are royally pissed
              off. </p>
            <p><strong>March 18</strong>  Kevin stopped overnight after a business trip
              to a local hospital. I tried on his suit jacket. I'm down from
              a size 44 regular to a size 38 regular. The incredible shrinking
              man. </p>
            <p><strong>March 21</strong>  Yesterday was a very disappointing day. I started
              with high hopes of actually making progress with eating and ended
              up with a terrible day trying to keep food down. My intake was
              actually a mediocre 1655 calories but in reality it was probably
              less than 500 that I actually kept from barfing along with heavy
              phlegm. I lost weight badly dropping from 140.4 to 138.8, the lowest
              point in my cycle so far. It wasn't all water loss either because
              I was able to drink without throwing up everything I sipped. </p>
            <p><strong>March 23-24</strong>  Carolee and I did an overnighter to Providence
              - sort of a trial run to see how I'll do on the trip overseas.
              We bought me a suit - Navy pinstripe at Nordstrom's. The salesman
              and the tailor had differing ideas about my first choice and I
              finally decided to cut and go with my second choice. I am down
              from a size 44 to 38 Regular. My shirt size is down from 16 to
              either 14.5 or 15 with a 33 sleeve. I picked up a blue shirt with
              a silver gray tie. I like the stuff but at nearly 780 bucks I got
              sticker shock. I haven't bought a suit since the late 1980s. It
              is weird to think of myself as a &quot;smaller&quot; person. I
              was quite tired by the time I crashed at the Marriott's CourtYard
              where we used a awards night from earlier trips. </p>
            <p><strong>March 26</strong>  Had an office visit with Dr. Knisley which went
              very well. We had some questions which came back fine. We asked
              when we would be doing some follow up testing - basically it will
              be toward the end of May after chemo has had two months to work
              itself out. I checked on the &quot;bump&quot; in my hand. As expected
              it is part of my DuPretyn's Syndrome - a cyst where the tendon
              enters the finger. I asked about the trip and whether I needed
              any special medications or should avoid any medications like sea
              sickness drugs. The answer was take whatever a normal person would
              take. I asked about my bending over and was told that exercise
              was the ticket there but that I had no problem. We discussed my
              continuing weight loss and eating problems but Dr. Knisley wasn't
              particularly worried and said he expected me to put on 5-10 pounds.
              We'll be seeing Dr. Knisley again in early May. </p>
            <p><strong>March 28</strong>  Carolee and I made a trip to Enfield Connecticut
              to see Ellen and Mo before he dies which is likely in the next
              few days. Basically he has renal failure after abscesses in his
              kidneys. I find it hard to believe that his battle with colon cancer
              isn't involved in someway but perhaps not. The trip was physically
              hard on me because I could not keep any food at all down all day. </p>
            <p><strong>April</strong>  Carolee and I took a trip on the Princess Star through
              Italy, Greece with stopovers in Croatia and Turkey. I ate pureeed
              regular meals. </p>
            <p><strong>May 3</strong>  I discussed my current blood preassure condition
              with Dr. Lentz. I am now back on regular half year check-ups rather
              than monthly check-ups. </p>
            <p><strong>May 10-13</strong>  After several days with extreme mucous problems
              and an inability to eat anything, Dr. Knisley called Dr. Lavigne.
              The upshot of it was I had my first dialation (in a series of dialations).
              My anastimosis was very narrow and Dr. Lavigne had trouble inserting
              the EGD tube. After the dilation I was able to swallow for a couple
              of days, but today (April 13), the mucous has returned after I
              tried to eat a Graham Cracker. I am scheduled for a second dilation
              in two weeks. </p>
            <p><strong>May 17</strong>  Dr. DiPetrillo asked to see me for a final time.
              Basically he offered to resume anytime I think I might need his
              opinion but effectively we are through radiation. </p>
            <p><strong>May 26</strong>  Office visit with Dr. Lavigne in preparation for
              second dialation. </p>
            <p><strong>June 1</strong>  I went into Westerly Hospital for my second dialation
              a day early. This was lucky because a piece of Brazil nut had closed
              off the anastimosis and I had been unable to eat or drink since
              May 29 at the Brown University Reunion. Dr. Lavigne was (rightly)
              very annoyed with me. I have dropped (partially due to dehydration)
              to an all time low weight of 134.0 pounds. After the dialation
              my eating has been considerably better. </p>
            <p><strong>June 14</strong>  Meeting with Dr. Knisley in preparation for CT
              Scan. He is very happy with my progress. </p>
            <p><strong>June 18</strong>  Yesterday, my throat closed down and I couldn't
              eat. I was concerned that I would not be able to drink the contrast
              dye in preparation for my CT Scan at 8 AM. However I had no problem
              swallowing the quart of liquid in two sessions of a pint each.
              Stuff tastes slightly metallic but compared to some of the &quot;food
              drinks&quot; I used to have to take it is ambrosia. </p>
            <p><strong>June 21</strong>  Office visit to Dr. Lavigne to discuss
              a <strong>THIRD
                DIALATION</strong>. We will hold this in abeyance for the time
                being. My 2000 colonoscopy &quot;polyps&quot; turned out to be
                benign, so we will not do another colonoscopy for a period of
                perhaps a few years. </p>
            <p>Dr. Knisley called with the results of the CT Scan. They are ambiguous
              but contain &quot;shadows&quot; or &quot;granularities&quot; in
              the left lung. Certainly not the glowing bill of health that I
              was hoping to receive. Perhaps I will advance the date of my meeting
              with Dr. Knisley to discuss these results more completely. </p>
            <p><strong>July 2</strong>  While visiting Kevin and Mary, I became dizzy at
              the Air and Space Museum and passed a small amount of dark urine.
              At their house I passed a good deal of bloody red urine. I called
              Dr. Knisley's office after hours and talked to Angela who told
              me to get to an ER. In the ER, Dr. Kevin Campbell confirmed I was
              passing blood but said it was unlikely to be kidney stones. He
              said that it is probably a polyp or a tumor in my bladder. </p>
            <p><strong>July 8</strong>  I met with Dr. Franklin Leddy (my urologist) in
              fis office today. I will be scheduled for a bladder examination
              to rule out any possible cancer spread. </p>
            <p><strong>July 13</strong>  I had a follow up PET Scan at Lawrence & Memorial
              Hospital in New London. The results of this which came back roughly
              a week later indicated that the shadows seen in my left lung were
              scar tissue and almost certainly benign. Once again I am officially
              NED. </p>
            <p><strong>July 19</strong>  Today's weeting with Dr. Knisley was routine. He
              was glad to see I am slowly putting on weight. </p>
            <p><strong>July 27</strong>  Dr. Leddy performed a cytoscope examination on
              my bladder. There are no polyps or tumors. The prostate is enlarger
              and the blood vessels near the urinary tract are near the surface
              and fragile. They appear to be the cause of the bleeding and are
              minor. </p>
            <p><strong>July 29</strong>  After having severe swallowing difficulties yesterday
              afternoon, saliva collecting and a complete shutdown except for
              a spoonful of ice cream today, I called Dr. Lavigne's office and
              had my third dialation today. I will have to make another appointment
              to have something a little more permanent done. Dr. Lavigne's Nurse
              Practioner (Lori?) suggested that this might be a stent. In a way
              I hope it isn't. </p>
            <p><strong>August 16</strong>  Dr. Lentz office visit went particularly well.
              How can I tell? Easy, he is scheduling my next visit more than
              four months out! </p>
            <p><strong>August 23</strong> I had my fourth (and hopefully final) dilation
              with Dr. Lavigne today. I am eating quite well and easily subsequent
              to these dilations. </p>
            <p><strong>September 2</strong>  I can't help feeling that in some way today
              is graduation day. At least it is the doctor's office visit closest
              to my one year anniversary of surgery. Dr. Knisley is extremely
              pleased with the way evrything is going. I have put on some real
              weight and am now 149.0 pounds. Even though I no longer measure
              my food proportions, I am obviously eating enough to gain.
