            <p><IMG align=right SRC="http://eccafe.org/sto/cchester.jpg" width="250" height="360">I am Claudia Chester, and I am surviving "Cancer 
              of the Esophagus". I continue to be victorious over this frightening disease, after almost five years. </p>
            <P> I live in Muskegon Michigan, have been happily married for 32 years, am the mother of four wonderful children, 
              and grandmother to 3 lovely girls. 
            <P> On July 20 the of 1992, at the age of 48, I was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma, at the gastric juncture. I 
              remember, every terrifying word from the doctors lips, at that horrifying moment. The word "cancer" was literally 
              gut wrenching for me. I felt the prospect of imminent death looming in front of me, and could only think of 
              all that I had left undone, or unsaid, in my life. 
            <P> My gastroentoligist, set me up with appointments with an oncologist, and radiation oncologist, and my life 
              began to careen out of control. My staging was determined to be 0 to 1, and I was blessed to find out that this 
              early diagnosis, could be life saving for me, and set about with a very positive attitude to win over this horrible 
              disease, and pay whatever price required, to do any and all things my doctors suggested. 
            <P> I began treatment of chemo 5fu, cistplatain, and platinol, in conjunction with radiation, for a period of 
              six weeks. My treatment protocol was devastating on me physically, and I required hospitalization, on three 
              occasions, just for the side effects of my treatment. I lost around 40 pounds, and all of my hair during this 
              time frame. The support of my wonderful family, is what gave me the strength and determination, to make it through 
              this devastating time. 
            <P> I was allowed to recover from the chemo radiation for about a month, before being sent to Dr. Mark Orringer, 
              at the University Of Michigan, for my Esophagectomy, and gastric pull up surgery. At the time I was very distressed 
              to have to go so very far, for my surgery, as it meant that my family would be unable to be with me, but I now 
              feel that , I was very blessed to have the best possible surgeon and care available in our area, at the time 
            <P> I currently take essiac, mega anti oxidents, shark cartlege, and drink green tea, I am of the what can it 
              hurt mind frame here, and don't seem to catch every bug that is going around, so whatever , I'm doing must be 
              helping. 
            <P> I now enjoy, even a fuller life than BC (before cancer) My husband and I take all the vacations, that we used 
              to put off " Till we retire ." We camp, hike, bike, and I love to spend time at the beautiful beaches here in 
              Michigan. I maintain a very positive attitude, and consider each beautiful day, a gift, and try my best to fill 
              it with all the joys, that life has to offer. 
            <P> In closing, let me, and the others who survive, give you hope, that this disease can be beaten, and I pray 
              that you to may be blessed to be a "Victor" over Cancer of the Esophagus. 
            <P> <I>--Claudia Chester, June 1997</I>
