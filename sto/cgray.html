                Top 10 Tips for EC
              </h2>
            </div>
            <h4 align="center">By Carol Gray</h4>
            <p> <img src="/sto/cgray.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">My husband, Joseph Blaustein, lost his courageous battle April
              16, 2003, 20 months after being diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of
              the distal esophagus. He was 55 when diagnosed &amp; had never
              had a serious illness. In retrospect, he had a lot of predictors
              for EC (smoked a pack a day until 1975; his mother &amp; her 2
              brothers all had cancers; 10+ years of nasty heartburn; &amp; an
              ache in his chest the year before that was attributed to bronchitis)
              but he had a doctor who had never seen a case of EC.</p>
            <p>Early on, Joe did really well. He breezed through neo adjuvant
              chemo &amp; radiation, recovered well from THE surgery, had good
              pathology results (T1, N0), and returned to work &amp; to tennis.
              For 4 months he ate like a champ &amp; we celebrated beating the
              odds, but then in May that scary ache in his chest returned &amp; there
              were mets in his lungs, adrenal glands &amp; brain.</p>
            <p> He underwent whole brain radiation before he even had symptoms &amp; began
              chemo again. In July, with his white cell count very low, he contracted
              aspergillus, a nasty fungal infection, in his lungs. Kaiser sent
              him home to die, so we switched health plans. The new doctors called
              in an infectious disease specialist who prescribed Vfend (voriconazole)
              a new antifungal that actually worked. There was a 5 month break
              from cancer treatment while he regained his strength but also dealt
              with surgery for a detached retina &amp; a deep vein thrombosis
              in his leg requiring placement of a Greenfield filter. By December
              the tumors were growing again &amp; one chemo agent &amp; then
              another was tried to no avail. Tumors spread to his spine, ribs, &amp; liver.
              The final blow was a blood clot that developed in the superior
              vena cava, probably on the tip of the PICC line.</p>
            <p>This is one of so many sad tales posted here, but Joe was a remarkable
              man &amp; managed to squeeze a lot of living into these last months.
              That is the message of hope I want to convey, that even in the
              throes of this horrible illness, you can find moments of joy&amp; delight &amp; profound
              meaning. Joe decided that his illness would not be a secret &amp; by
              sharing what was happening, he drew support from family, friends, &amp; co-workers.
              They found time to visit &amp; our house was filled with company.
              They picked Joe up, wheelchair, oxygen &amp; all, &amp; took him
              on outings. Between pre-op treatment &amp; surgery, we splurged
              on a fabulous cruise through the Panama Canal. Just 10 days before
              the end, our children created their own &quot;Make a Wish&quot; foundation &amp; flew
              us 1st class to a family party in Philadelphia where Joe amazed
              us all by donning his tux &amp; dancing one slow dance with me.
              He kept busy with e-mail, sending jokes far &amp; wide. He supported
              the economy by buying gifts on-line for many of the people dear
              to him. At each stage of his illness, he found activities that
              he liked &amp; could still manage.</p>
            <p> We learned some practical lessons along the way, and though they
              might seem obvious, I'll pass them along in hopes they might be
              helpful to someone else:</p>

                <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><h4>1. There really
                      are no clear treatment guidelines.</h4>
                  <p>Although we read countless journal articles &amp; spoke
                    to many doctors trying to sort out treatment options, the
                    studies &amp; statistics did not provide a clear recommendation.</p>

                <td width="50%" bgcolor="#CCFFCC"><h4>2. Know your infusion
                      pump.</h4>
                  <p>We relied on a nurse who set up the equipment &amp; told
                    us it was fool-proof. Although we checked with her again
                    2 days later, she still did not see that she had assembled
                    it incorrectly. When we finally figured it out for ourselves,
                    we saw that she had not closed the pump properly &amp; the
                    wheel that pushes fluid along was not in contact with the
                    tubing.</p>

                  <p>The first surgeon assigned was annoyed by questions &amp; angry
                    when we insisted on preoperative staging (EUS &amp; PET scan).
                    We asked every connection we could think of until we found
                    someone who knew the best surgeon available with Joe's health
                    plan. He was reassuring, drew pictures to explain procedures,
                    even congratulated Joe on the shape of his rib cage which
                    he said would make the operation easier to do.</p>
                </td>
                <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><h4>4. Don't worry about cisplatin
                      harming your hearing, the other drugs will also harm it.</h4>
                  <p>Because Joe had a serious hearing loss from childhood, he
                    opted for taxol &amp; 5-FU for the first chemotherapy &amp; it
                    increased his hearing loss. When the disease metastasized,
                    he figured cisplatin was his best bet &amp; it also increased
                    his hearing loss, but not as much as the first drugs.</p>

                      a primary care doctor who knows the system.</h4>
                  <p>Although Joe only saw this doctor twice, she was a marvel
                    of efficiency, getting the right referrals without delay.
                    She did thorough physical exams, understood the significance
                    of symptoms,&amp; sent Joe to the appropriate specialists.</p>

                <td bgcolor="#CCFFCC"><h4>6. Demand appointments.</h4>
                  <p>Don't be put off by secretaries who offer you appointments
                    in two months time. If the situation seems serious, explain,
                    be insistent, &amp; get an appointment within a week. </p>

                      watch for &amp; what constitutes an emergency.</h4>
                  <p>When Joe's foot swelled up we had no idea that solid tumors
                    leave you prone to blood clots &amp; that it was a critical
                    situation. A nurse asked, &quot;Is this your FIRST clot?&quot;</p>
                </td>
                <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><h4>8. Don't tolerate pain.</h4>
                  <p>Everything is worse when you're hurting. Good pain control
                    that doesn't leave the patient in a stupor, is possible.
                    You won't get a medal for bravery so take the prescribed
                    pain medications.</p>

                  <p>Make a list as you go of doctor appointments, prescriptions,
                    co-payments, mileage &amp; parking. If you have to reconstruct
                    it from calendars &amp; receipts at the end of the year as
                    we did, it will take you 2 weeks of work &amp; cussing.</p>

                  <p>You're going to be home a lot. Get a satellite dish, a DVD
                    player, TIVO, &amp; subscriptions to the sports channels
                    if you like sports. And don't forget headphones if you're

            <p>I regret that I didn't post to the entire [EC-]group but only
              replied to individuals from time to time. I was intimidated by
              how large an audience there was. I'll close with my thanks to everyone
              on the EC list who was willing to share &amp; provided a sense
              of community &amp; a source of practical advice through this ordeal.
              My special gratitude goes to AL who spent an evening with
              us on the phone at the beginning. There were days when I couldn't
              bear to read the postings, but I kept coming back to follow your
              journeys which so closely paralleled ours.</p>
            <p>To those who are fighting EC &amp; those who are caring for them,
              I offer these words from a prayer that has sustained me:</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>May the source of strength, who blessed
                the ones before us;<br>
Help us find the courage to make our lives a blessing<br>
And let us say, Amen.</strong></p>
