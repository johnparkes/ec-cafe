            <h3 align="center">Tom O'Connor's story &#8211; by Marjie O'Connor</h3>
            <p>Talk about dumb luck. If it weren't for my 65-year-old husband
              getting a stomach virus in April of last year, we'd be spending
              at least the first part of this year in blissful ignorance of the
              cancer that very likely would have killed him before the end of
              next year. And maybe just as ignorant of the heart disease that
              very likely would have killed him well before then. I've never
              been so grateful to a virus!</p>
            <p> I came home from work one night to find Tom not feeling at all
              well. His stomach was bothering him. However, his stomach had been
              bothering him for years, and he didn't seem to think it was enough
              of a problem to demand that his primary care physician check it
              out. So when he told me he wasn't hungry, I just thought, &quot;Oh,
              good. I don't have to make dinner.&quot;</p>
            <p> Callous? Oh, yes! But you know how calluses are developed: constant
              irritation or pressure to the same spot. I'd thrown up my hands
              in despair at Tom's GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder) years
              ago. He was in enough discomfort that he spent at least part of
              every night sleeping in his recliner. He kept bottles of over-the-counter
              antacids in his nightstand. He talked to his doctor about it, and
              the doctor prescribed the first of a series of medications. I don't
              remember now which it was &#8211; Pepcid AC, I think.</p>
            <p> As time progressed, Tom's condition worsened. However, his doctor
              did nothing other than change the medication &#8211; first Prilosec,
              then Prevacid. He never ordered any tests, and Tom &#8211; being
              a guy &#8211; never made enough of a stink about it to try to force
              the doctor's hand in the matter.</p>
            <p> I, however, being unencumbered by testosterone, did everything
              I could to rock the boat enough to get the doctor's attention.
              I sent him two faxes to provide more detailed information about
              just how much the GERD was affecting Tom's life. (I don't think
              the term GERD had even been brought up at this point, though.)
              When that failed, I actually accompanied Tom to a regular check-up
              (he's also diabetic), figuring I could convince the doctor to get
              to the root of the problem if I talked to him in person.</p>
            <p> I was wrong. I explained my concern that Tom had ulcers, a hiatal
              hernia, or both. The doc just brushed aside my worry with a blas&eacute; explanation
              that Tom's sleep apnea created a vacuum that pulled stomach contents
              up into his esophagus. I was not satisfied, but I decided that
              if Tom didn't mind the discomfort and pain, and his doctor wasn't
              worried, I'd just quit nagging.</p>
            <h3> This is <em>not</em> apnea</h3>
            <p> Fast forward a couple of years to April 2002 and the fortuitous
              stomach flu. By bedtime, Tom was vomiting pretty hard. Vomiting
              was not unusual for him, so I just told him, &quot;Good night,&quot; and
              headed upstairs. Quite frankly, I was tired of dealing with what
              appeared to be just an unusually bad case of reflux.</p>
            <p> But at 4:30 the next morning, I was awakened by the sounds of
              Tom vomiting again, and more forcefully. Now that wasn't normal,
              so I ran downstairs to discover he was experiencing projectile
              vomiting. But even worse was the fact that the vomitus was black.
              It looked like someone had thrown India ink all over the bathroom.
              I told Tom, &quot;That's it. You don't get to decide anymore. I
              am calling your doctor.&quot;</p>
            <p> Fortunately for both of us, Tom had finally switched doctors
              after my company switched to an insurance network that didn't include
              Dr. Apathy. I reached his new doctor within a matter of minutes,
              and he advised us to go to the emergency room. Gosh, sounded like
              a good idea to me! So off we went.</p>
            <p> I won't bore you with the details of a Day in the ER. But by
              late afternoon, Tom had been admitted to the hospital and undergone
              an endoscopy &#8211; also known as an esophagoscopy. A gastroenterologist
              put a tiny camera down Tom's throat to see where the bleeding was
              coming from and take some biopsies. And whaddya know? There were
              a whole bunch of esophageal ulcers! A hiatal hernia! And as a bonus,
              inflammation of the stomach and discoloration of the duodenum!
              As one of the nurses put it, Tom's esophagus looked like raw hamburger
              meat.<br>
              Now, I try really hard not to say, &quot;I told you so!&quot; I
              really do. But I just let him have it as he was coming out from
              the sedation. I was truly obnoxious, but after all those years
              of biting my tongue, I just couldn't do it any longer. So by the
              time the doctor came in, Tom was good and sick of me gloating.
              (So was I, for that matter.)</p>
            <p> As it turned out, Tom had developed a condition called Barrett's
              esophagus, in which cells from the stomach wash up into the gullet
              with the acid, and eventually take root in the irritated tissues
              and start growing. About 5%-10% of GERD sufferers develop Barrett's,
              and about 5%-10% of those who develop Barrett's eventually develop
              cancer. But Tom's biopsies came back negative, and we breathed
              a huge sigh of relief. We left the hospital with yet another medication
              (Nexium this time), a low-acid diet to get the esophagus to heal
              up, and advice to eat several small meals a day to keep from overfilling
              the stomach at one time.<br>
              A humbler, quieter Tom started taking more responsibility for his
              own health. He was very faithful to the new regimen; his experiences
              in the ER were painful enough that he didn't want to repeat them
              again. So we went back six weeks later for a follow-up endoscopy
              hoping that there would be significant improvement. </p>
            <p> And there was! The ulcers were almost healed; the inflammation
              was gone. The doctor was very pleased with Tom's progress. He said
              he'd taken another biopsy, but that everything looked good, and
              that we should have the Barrett's checked again in a couple of
              years. We had dodged the bullet &#8211; we thought.</p>
            <h3> Never mind ...</h3>
            <p> The next day, Tom got a call from the same doctor. This biopsy &#8211; taken
              with a much clearer view of the tissue now all that inflammation
              was gone &#8211; was positive: signet cell adenocarcinoma. Tom
              called me at work to tell me, and I went into some kind of altered
              state right away. My dad had died of colon cancer 15 years before;
              I knew what cancer meant.</p>
            <p> For the next week, I spent hours every night researching esophageal
              cancer on the Internet. My findings left me in tears. EC is relatively
              unusual, but it is also unusually lethal. The most recent statistics
              indicate an 85% mortality rate. It is the fastest-growing kind
              of cancer in the United States (it is much more common in some
              other countries). There are actually two kinds of EC: adeno (as
              Tom had) and squamous cell. </p>
            <p> Risk factors include being male (men get EC two to three times
              more often than women); being black; being a smoker and/or a drinker
              (more directly related to squamous cell EC); and suffering from
              GERD (more related to adeno). About the only risk factor Tom didn't
              have was his race, although he had quit smoking when he met me
              13 years ago (I can't tolerate tobacco smoke) and had essentially
              quit drinking when he was diagnosed with diabetes several years
              later.</p>
            <p> Like ovarian cancer and colon cancer, EC is usually symptom-free
              until it's too late. But here's where we got lucky: Because of
              that stupid stomach flu, we had found Tom's cancer much earlier
              than usual: Stage IIa instead of the all-too-common Stage IV. </p>
            <p> So here we are in the last quarter of 2003. Since Tom's diagnosis
              in May of last year, he has undergone a quadruple bypass for heart
              disease discovered in the course of testing him for his ability
              to withstand cancer treatment. He flunked the stress test, then
              flunked the angiogram a few days later. He had between 85% and
              95% blockage in all major arteries going to his heart. It's a minor
              miracle he hadn't dropped dead already.</p>
            <p> One month and 10 days after the heart operation, Tom started
              six weeks of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation. Five and a
              half weeks following the last radiation treatment, he had an esophagectomy.
              The surgeons made two large incisions &#8211; one from the sternum
              to the navel and one curving all the way around his right shoulder
              blade &#8211; that allowed them to remove the esophagus, the top
              part of his stomach and some lymph nodes, and pull the rest of
              Tom's stomach up through his diaphragm to form a new esophagus
              and stomach, which is now located in Tom's chest. It's called the
              Ivor-Lewis procedure, and depending on whom you talk to, it's either
              the most invasive surgery performed, or the second most invasive
              after transplants. Between the I-L and the bypass, Tom looks like
              he has had a zipper installed the length of his torso &#8211; and
              taken some bullets and stab wounds, too. </p>
            <p> Once Tom healed up sufficiently from the esophagectomy, he started
              another six weeks of chemo. He had no leakage at the anastomosis &#8211; the
              point in the throat at which the new &quot;esophagus&quot; is attached
              to the stump of the old one. He had no infections, and he only
              needed supplemental feeding for a week through a j-tube; liquid
              nutrition was administered through a tube inserted directly into
              the small intestine.</p>
            <h3> Counting our blessings</h3>
            <p> The good news here is that it looks like will be around to show
              off his scars for a long time to come. He bounced back from surgery
              beautifully. The pathologist could find &quot;no living cancer
              cells&quot; anywhere in the considerable amount of tissue removed
              during Tom's esophagectomy. It looks now like we've got the coveted &quot;complete
              response&quot; to treatment. It looks now like we've beaten the
              cancer.</p>
            <p> I know, I know. Once you've had cancer, you can never be really
              sure it won't come back. Just this week, I heard of another case
              of &quot;complete response&quot; to treatment for EC who now has
              secondary tumors riddling his skeletal system. That shook me badly.
              There is no safe haven from this disease. EC is especially sneaky,
              and because it's so unusual, there isn't even a standard protocol
              for treating it.</p>
            <p> Tom still is learning to deal with his new plumbing. He can't
              eat as much as before, and he lost about 28 lb. since this all
              started. If he does eat too much, he pays for it with several hours
              of pretty bad discomfort. But he can eat just about anything he
              wants; many post-esophagectomy patients have to wait for year before
              they can resume anything close to normal diets, if they every can
              at all. </p>
            <p> In October 2003, Tom had to have his new esophagus dilated to
              open up a stricture caused by scar tissue. About one-third of esophagectomy
              patients face that &#8211; in many cases, multiple times annually
              for years. The dilation was performed during an endoscopy, which
              was done to take an up-close-and-personal view of the new esophagus
              to make sure nothing scary was going on. A routine biopsy was also
              done, which is standard procedure during an endoscopy.<br>
              Thanks for sticking with me this far. But please do me a favor,
              too. If you or someone you love suffers from chronic GERD, insist
              on an endoscopy to rule out Barrett's esophagus. If Barrett's is
              present, it should be monitored by annual endoscopies and biopsies.
              As with every other kind of cancer, catching EC early is critical
              to curing it. If your doctor seems indifferent to a problem or
              stumped about what to do about it, find a new doctor!</p>
            <p> There is more information about EC at <a href="/web/20100926125612/http://www.ecaware.org/">http://www.ecaware.org/</a> or <a href="/index.html">http://www.eccafe.org/</a>.
              There also are stories of other EC patients on both sites. Not
              all of them have happy endings. And most of them have had much
              more difficult journeys than we've had. Thanks to that stomach
              flu, we discovered the EC and &#8211; just as important &#8211; the
              heart disease. I don't know whether it was just dumb luck or God
              tapping us on the shoulder, but I repeat: I've never been so grateful
              to the flu.</p>
