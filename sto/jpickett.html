                  <h2 align="center">It has been 32 years that I have survived
                    this journey.<br>
                    I will try to be brief and not dwell on the details.</h2>
                  <p><img src="/sto/jpickett.jpg" width="288" height="281" align="right">At age 34 I was diagnosed with Sqamous 
                    Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus. I had felt as if there was a problem for two years prior to the diagnosis. 
                    I first went to an ENT in Durham, NC, pointedly asked him if I had cancer and his response was "No Honey, 
                    it's just your nerves." We moved to West Palm Beach, FL and about a year later I went to see another ENT 
                    who prescribed tranquilizers for my "Nerves" and sent me home. I continued to suffer with terrible indigestion 
                    and finally got to the point where I couldn't swallow liquids and lost a great deal of weight in a short 
                    period of time. I consulted an Internist and he hospitalized me and a large mass was found in my esophagus. 
                    We then went to Miami for a biopsy which first came back negative, but the surgeon wasn't convinced that 
                    the results were right and felt we should do another biopsy which came back positive for sqamous cell 
                    carcinoma of the esophagus. We were told to get our affairs in order and that I had only a few weeks to 
                    6 months to live. We then went to a specialist in St. Louis for a second opinion. This surgeon performed 
                    another biopsy and the tumor was found to be inoperable. He told us there was nothing he could do and 
                    he didn't know if anyone would accept me as a patient for radiation treatments. I mentioned a Dr. in Gainesville, 
                    FL that I had heard of thru friends at the University of Florida. He was called and Dr. Rodney Million 
                    the head of the radiation oncology department agreed to see me. </p>
                  <p>My primary oncologist was a Dr. Terry Kraus who will forever be my "HERO." Dr. Kraus had a very upbeat 
                    personality and was extremely caring and kind. I felt he was truly interested in me as a person and wanted 
                    very badly to succeed. He used as an example a woman he knew had survived for 6 years after EC, so that 
                    6 years became my goal. Dr. Kraus stressed to me over and over that if I survived the cancer, the odds 
                    were very great that I would be paralyzed from the neck down as a result of the radiation to my spine. 
                    We proceeded with the radiation, treating the front of my neck and chest every day, alternating each side 
                    and my back the other days. For about a year after my treatments I experienced a tingling sensation each 
                    time I would bend my neck, this went all the way to my toes. I had a radiation fracture to the spine. 
                    There has been no paralysis. I have to have a dilatation every three months as I have a tight stricture 
                    from the scar tissue that built up from the radiation. I used to become apprehensive about the dilatation's 
                    fearing that if we bothered the area, the cancer would return. That is no longer a concern since I've 
                    had so many. The doctor uses a pediatric scope over fluoroscope for the dilatation's. She prefers using 
                    the Maloneys, but I have also had the balloons. I was afraid I would become addicted to the Demerol and 
                    the Versed and I'm not so sure that I haven't. I love the way the Versed makes me sleep. She assures me 
                    that I'm not addicted. </p>
                  <p> My husband Jim and I have been married for 42 years and at the time I was diagnosed we had three children, 
                    the youngest was only four years old. I was a light smoker and only drank occasionally. I lived in Guam 
                    for two years as a child. I remember my brother and I running behind a truck spraying DDT for mosquitos 
                    and breathing the fumes, this happened at least two nights a week. I remember having quite a bit of indigestion 
                    in my early teens, but that was in the 50's and you just didn't go to the doctor for that type of thing. 
                    My grandmother had Lymphoma and my Grandfather Stomach cancer, I lost an Aunt to Brain cancer and another 
                    had breast cancer, and an Uncle Stomach cancer. This was all on the maternal side of the family. </p>
                  <p> When I returned home, my days were very busy caring for three young children and running a household, 
                    I found the nights to be the hardest, that was when my mind had time to dwell on my situation. It was 
                    hard to think long-term. After a few months of this, I decided to change my life and I became active in 
                    a community center in our area. I set up exercise programs, bowling teams, belly dancing, haunted houses 
                    and parties. My husband and I took up tennis and we made many good friends along the way. Some nights 
                    I would go home totally exhausted, but whatever I was doing was keeping me alive. I have since worked 
                    and owned two businesses. My children have grown and have given me five wonderful grandchildren and one 
                    more on the way. </p>
                  <p> Five years ago, I was diagnosed with Malt Lymphoma of the stomach (Non-Hodgkins lymphoma). I was treated 
                    with heavy antibiotics and the cancer has been put into remission. Two years ago I had to have open heart 
                    surgery, a triple by-pass, this was determined to have been caused by the extensive radiation I received. 
                    What a small price to pay for 29 years of survival. My life has been so blessed. </p>
                  <p> My husband and I bought a home on a lake in Madison, Mississippi, he had retired twice, but is now doing 
                    consulting work in Las Vegas. I spend my time between Mississippi and Las Vegas, visiting my children, 
                    fishing, bridge and working in the yard. I am very active and you would not know to look at me that there 
                    has been any life threatening illnesses in my life. </p>
                  <p> I know I have rambled and you are probably not interested in all the details, but if my story can give 
                    just one person the will to fight this cancer even harder, that I have accomplished something. I know 
                    surgery may limit a persons ability to do everything I did and metastasis is grim, but try your mightiest 
                    to think positive and make each day a good one. </p>
