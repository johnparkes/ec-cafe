                  <p>Mary, 
                  <p>Your post serves as an important reality check for those engaged in this conversation. For me, the central 
                    focus of our discussion should be on sharing with each other our experiences "living with EC." Some of 
                    those participating are participating on behalf of those who once "lived with EC;" sharing with us the 
                    perspective of the real heroes in these "illness tales"--the care givers, the "supporting cast" who are 
                    left to "construct lives" in which the person with EC is no longer "present to them in the flesh."</p><p>Death must be a "major theme" in our conversation since with this particular disease, mortality rates 
                    are very high. Many of those participating in this conversation are doing so from the perspective of persons 
                    with "terminal illnesses;" they have the disease that will "take them to their deaths" absent an fatal 
                    injury from an accident. Making sure our "affairs are in order" should be part of this "theme."</p><p>I think our conversation if far too dominated by the theme of "doctors," hospitals, procedures and medical 
                    treatments. In short, we have allowed our dialogue to become "medicalized" to an extent that is not "healthy"</p><p>In terms of this issue of profanity, I am a very big fan of George Carlin. So......don't get me started 
                    on this one!

                  <p>There are a number of issues raised by your post that don't make sense. Why is he jaundiced? Why does 
                    he need a tube to "drain fluid from his stomach?" What is the nature of the fluid that accumulates "outside 
                    his lungs.?" Have multiple tests for cancer cells been done on this fluid? Has the fluid been cultured

                  <p>David, 
                  <p>1. Given the extent of your disease, cure is unlikely. Surgery at the conclusion of the Chemo + radiation 
                    may make sense in a small number of cases to remove areas of "residual disease." However, I wouldn't count 
                    on this being an important part of the management of your disease.</p><p>2. The treatment that you describe is appropriate, commonly-used "front line therapy" for this disease. 
                    In the event that you got to a place were there was "no evidence of disease" left, you would likely be 
                    followed by scans until you developed a relapse or recurrence of disease. At that point in time a variety 
                    of "salvage" or "second line" treatments would be discussed, primarily involving other chemotherapy drugs. 
                    If you have evidence of residual disease at the conclusion of your Chemo + rad, there are oncologists 
                    who would recommend your utilization of second line chemotherapy approaches at this time; or encourage 
                    you to participate in the study of new experimental drugs or combinations of drugs that are being studied 
                    in persons with EC and related diseases. Many people on this list have extensive experience with multiple 
                    chemotherapy agents that have been used to treat their EC. The archives contain a wealth of information 
                    re these drugs and drug combinations. There are also those who would encourage you to consider palliative 
                    or supportive care only in the event you had residual disease after Chemo + radiation.</p><p>3. The common claims by one major medical center that they have more advanced and better scanning equipment 
                    than other centers is usually bunk. Probably not essential that you press the issue. You could ask that 
                    the actual scans themselves be shared with the people you end up using for treatment back in Ohio. They 
                    could then give you their own, independent reading of the films.</p><p>bill bartholome

                  <p>Vicki, 
                  <p>Your evaluation of this situation is very appropriate. Would contact hospice directly. They will be able 
                    to help you procure the necessary medical referrals. The guidelines for Medicaid hospice benefit talk 
                    about "six months or less."</p><p>Pam and I have encountered another hurdle in our adventure with EC. About ten days ago, I began to experience 
                    dramatic increase in my pain level and the development of a new pain in my right shoulder and back. When 
                    the pain failed to respond to even high doses of narcotics and I began to lose sensation and function 
                    in my right hand, we bit the bullet and took me in for more scans. Well, the scans revealed that my disease 
                    has taken over the 7th vertebral body of my neck...is growing through the bone into the spinal canal..and 
                    putting pressure on my spinal cord. Ugh!</p><p>We were told that no treatment would mean increasing level of pain, disability and paralysis from the 
                    neck down in four to six weeks. The only intervention that we have been offered is palliative radiation 
                    to the spine. I just completed the fourth in a series of ten treatments. I now KNOW what you have all 
                    been talking about when you talk about the energy effects of radiation. I'm as weak as a kitten. Have 
                    been unable to even read the digests much less go to work.</p><p>Also got into major bowel troubles with my oral narcotic drug, oxycodone. Was taking 30 mg of the sustained 
                    release form of the drug, when my intestine simply stopped working. So, I've had to come off the narcotics 
                    for a while so I can get my bowels to work again. Am also on decadron to keep down the swelling in the 
                    area of my spinal cord and to prevent additional swelling from the radiation treatments.</p><p>So, the cancerous Bill continues to make steady advances on me. Keep us in your hearts.</p><p>bill bartholome and pam</p><hr>

                  <p>I know one doctor who refers everyone he knows with EC to the Internet.</p><p>Dr. Bill</p><p>Seriously, docs are very concerned re the quality of information people get in support groups. Little 
                    do they know how seriously we take our obligations to attempt to give each other the best information 
                    we can get our hands on...and the kind of support that only a fellow sufferer can give. I have learned 
                    far more about this disease from this group than from all the docs I work with...and I work in an academic 
                    medical center.</p><hr>

                  <p>Would strongly support caregivers and other support folk seeing tears as nothing more than the natural 
                    expression of grief in a person facing death. Dying involves doing this kind of "grief work." Those of 
                    us who are fortunate enough to be able to have some time to live with our terminal illnesses, have the 
                    opportunity to experience this kind of grief work...grief over the end of one's self...one's loss of self.</p><p>Do NOT see tears as a sign to "back off" or stop talking. Encourage the crying person to continue talking 
                    while crying...try to be as comfortable as possible in the face of the grieving person. Obviously, caretakers 
                    and support people have their own grief work to do. But, these are problems and "tasks" that can and should 
                    be kept separate. It is not necessary (and usually not very helpful) for everyone to do grief work simultaneously. 
                    And, it is important to remember that there is not need for survivors to hurry their own grief work...there 
                    will be plenty of time for survivor grief work.</p><p>I think it also important for us all to realize that there is a limit to the extent that mental health 
                    providers and psychiatric drugs can "treat" or "help" dying people deal with loss and separation. Dying 
                    involves issues for us that transcend the psychological.</p><p>bill bartholome

                  <p>Control is a major issue. Being a cancer patient involves a dramatic loss of control. Strongly suggest 
                    that caregivers to your father-in-law work closely with him to develop a set of goals for his treatment. 
                    A willingness to "fight" is not an adequate statement of goals of treatment. Your father-in-law has a 
                    terminal illness. This means that traditional goals of treatment like cure or getting rid of the cancer 
                    or the like will not work in his case.</p><p>Also not at all clear what the goals are of his radiation treatment. Given the often overwhelming burdens 
                    of cancer treatment, it is very important for everyone to be very clear about why things are being done 
                    and what expectations are reasonable.

                  <p>My spinal cord symptoms (pain and loss of function in my right hand) did not respond to radiation treatment. 
                    Ended up doing 12 treatments (maximum dose my spinal cord could tolerate) instead of 10. Finished treatment 
                    last Friday. (Free at last!)</p><p>Have officially signed up as a patient of our new Palliative Care Service. Hope that my status as a palliative 
                    care patient will help protect me from getting sucked back into the cancer patient role.</p><p>Very frustrating that I have experienced no benefits from this ordeal; and have experienced the full 
                    range of burdens and side effects. Still to weak to do much other than get out of bed. Have no clue re 
                    when (or even if) I will be able to return to work. My voice is horrible...the vocal cord paralysis plus 
                    the radiation damage to the larynx has left me with little more than a whisper. My throat and epiglottis 
                    are so sore that it hurts to swallow my own saliva!</p><p>Did manage to get a major project launched. Spent two days with Bill Moyers and his crew from PBS working 
                    on a series of specials on end-of-life issues. The series will actually not air until the year 2000, but 
                    it was good to get the film in the can as they say.</p><p>Keep us in your hearts. Continue to do this most important work. What we offer each other as fellow sufferers 
                    on this road is invaluable. People will look back at this time and this kind of forum as a major breakthrough 
                    in how human beings deal with the burdens of illness.

                  <p>Linda, 
                  <p>I large part, your analysis is right on target. More people (particularly in so called "developed nations" 
                    are NOT dying of other things at younger ages; thus living long enough to develop cancer. From one very 
                    "real world perspective" if we were to ever "win" the war on cancer (which will not happen), we will all 
                    live long enough to experience the disintegration of the self called dementia. Ain't life grand!!!</p><p>In a sense, we all "need a disease" in order to experience a good death. For many Americans, cancer may 
                    be a "good road" to death. It is one of the longer roads. It is also one which is quite predictable in 
                    terms of the natural history of the disease. It is also a disease that fits well into the hospice model 
                    of home-based care of the dying person. It even fits the increasingly desired Baby Boomer model of conscious 
                    dying. We have developed very reasonable forms of palliative care of cancer-related symptoms.</p><p>So in an important sense, cancer may be an old woman's friend in much the same way we used to say, pneumonia 
                    can be the old man's best friend.</p><p>Food for thought.</p>
