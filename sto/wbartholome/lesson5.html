            <h3 align="center">Lesson 5 - America's Need for &quot;Rituals of Withdrawal&quot;</h3>
            <p>I've titled lesson five: America's need for &quot;rituals of withdrawal.&quot; Over the past decade America 
              has been dealing with &quot;Outlaw Jack&quot; in Michigan and a huge cultural convulsion, which reached its 
              zenith in the State of Oregon when they passed legislation allowing for physician-assisted suicide for the terminally 
              ill. It seemed that large numbers of Americans were buying into the notion that if you want to have a good death, 
              you either have to join the Hemlock Society and &quot;off&quot; yourself; or work to pass laws that would allow 
              your doctor to give you the assistance you need to off yourself.</p>
            <p>I found myself asking: &quot;Isn't this a symptom of some deeper problem?&quot; Why is America convulsed with 
              this technological quick fix? I came to see it as a manifestation of what some philosophers call hyper-modernity. 
              Not just &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot; which would be modernity, but &quot;you can only live (and 
              die) if you get good chemistry,&quot; which is hyper modernity. The idea that in order to get dead, you need 
              to either kill yourself or find somebody to assist you in killing yourself is bogus. People in other societies, 
              in other cultures and in other times have been getting dead without suicide or without physician-assisted suicide 
              for a long damn time. As a matter of fact, you can get dead whenever you're ready. All you have to do is withdraw 
              from the world and you'll die as predictably as the sun will come up tomorrow. It's interesting that a lot of 
              old folks in nursing homes and extended-care facilities are discovering this and it's sort of spreading in a 
              counter-cultural movement. Often in whispers, they tell each other: &quot;All you've got to do is keep your 
              mouth shut!&quot; Don't let them put anything in your mouth! Tear out any tubes that they try to stick in you 
              and you'll be dead. It works. It's a wonderful solution. Why don't we in almost Twenty-first Century America 
              have rituals of withdrawal to support people who are ready to get dead? </p>
            <p>Why can't hospice say to people, &quot;If you're ready to die, come to us and we'll help you die&quot;? Hospices 
              don't say that, do they? They say, &quot;We neither prolong life or shorten life.&quot; When you're sick of 
              life and ready to go, you want to get dead. You want to go. You've had enough. The burdens are intolerable. 
              Do you have to kill yourself or find a doctor, or can we have in this highly-evolved society some of the rituals 
              that so-called primitive or underdeveloped societies all over the world have to support people who are ready 
              to withdraw? In not so enlightened eighteenth and nineteenth century America there was such a ritual. Your great-grandmother 
              may very well have engaged in the ritual. It was called &quot;taking to bed.&quot; Granny came out and announced 
              to the family, &quot;This is it, folks. I'm taking to bed.&quot; And, she went in bed and stayed in bed until 
              she was dead. And everybody knew what that meant and how to behave around a person who had taken to bed. Some 
              old people who had taken to bed died in days or a few weeks. Some old people who took to bed got comfortable 
              with it, and ended up spending years in bed! </p>
            <p>It was about this time that I wrote my second meditation: &quot;STILL/HERE Above Ground.&quot; In it, I reflected 
              on what we had learned during our second year of living with dying. I wrote out my own &quot;ritual of withdrawal,&quot; 
              how that was going to work for me. I also introduced the idea of &quot;living by the calendar.&quot; I don't 
              know about the rest of you, but when I read Buddhists talk about live each day as if it was the last day you 
              were going to be alive, and when you go to sleep at night be prepared for not waking up in the morning, I can't 
              do that. That makes life really hard for me. But what I did discover was that I could live by the calendar method. 
              I could live each day on the calendar as if it was the last time I would be above ground on that day. I could 
              live each birthday that way, each wedding anniversary, each spring, each Christmas.And it not only worked, it 
              actually made each of those days more special than they would have otherwise been.
