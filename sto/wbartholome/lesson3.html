            <h3 align="center"> Lesson 3 - Limitations of the Hospice Solution</h3>
            <p>Lesson three: &quot;Limitations of the Hospice Solution.&quot; As I was looking at my own death and wondering 
              about how I would die and where I would die and what I would need and what Pam would need and how it would all 
              shake down, I became convinced that there was one thing I knew about this business of dying in America. In twenty-five 
              years of working with dying children and their families, I had come to know that there is one group of people 
              who are seriously pursuing this idea of caring for the dying in the United States. It is the people who have 
              been part of the hospice movement for the past twenty-five years.</p>
            <p>So I became convinced that for me my dying was going to take place under the care and support of a hospice 
              and that I was going to avail myself of this wonderful mechanism of getting oneself and one's family necessary 
              care and support. However, as I began to do make arrangements for that, I began to learn a lot about hospice 
              in America and what's happening with hospice in America. And, I have become convinced that this hospice solution 
              to the problem of dying in America is profoundly inadequate. It's not going to work, at least not the way we 
              have structured it right now. What's happened? What's happened is that what began as a social movement in which 
              volunteers and volunteer professionals played the major role in providing care for people who were dying has 
              been transformed into an industry. When hospice was forming as a counter-cultural alternative to mainstream 
              health care, money was the last thing that people worried about. Sure there were bake sales and car washes and 
              other kinds of fund-raisers and solicitations aimed at keeping a little bit of money coming in the door. But 
              there was little if any billing or concern about reimbursement for services by third-party payers. </p>
            <p>That changed in 1983 when the United States decided that hospice had come of age and what we needed was a hospice 
              Medicare benefit. So the leaders of the hospice movement including the fledgling National Hospice Organization 
              sat down with the people at HICFA and designed a hospice benefit for the Medicare program. The creation of this 
              revenue stream has radically transformed hospice from a social movement into an industry. There's actually a 
              significant for-profit presence in hospice in the United States today. Hospice care has become part of the medical 
              industrial complex and it has radically changed to the point that a lot of people who have been part of the 
              movement for twenty years are disgusted with it and are getting out. And other veterans of the movement are 
              trying hard to figure out how to reclaim something of the character of the original movement. </p>
            <p>There are a number of problems with it. Let me mention just two. One is that the hospice benefit as it's set 
              up right now requires that the patient be certified as terminally ill with an estimated six months to live before 
              they can be admitted into a hospice program. There are some real serious problems with that. One is that there 
              are some physicians, not a majority but clearly a significant minority of physicians, who never have terminally 
              ill patients. They don't believe in it. If you're their patient, you're either sick and in need of no-holds-barred 
              medical care or you are dead and beyond the reach of medicine. Another problem is that the revenue stream has 
              locked hospice into a little niche and only about 15 percent of Americans who die on an annual basis are being 
              served by hospice. That means 85 percent of us who die in America are getting nothing as we die and 15 percent 
              of us are getting Cadillac treatment. It's a haves' and have nots' thing. The people who have homes, caretakers, 
              health insurance and access to lots of social resources; the people who could probably do fairly well without 
              hospice services are being served. People without these resources are not being served. It's crazy. Something 
              has to be done.
