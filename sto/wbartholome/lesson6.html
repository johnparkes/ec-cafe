            <h2 align="center">Lessons of the Angel of Death</h2>
            <h5><a href="/sto/wbartholome/lesson5.html">Lesson 5 - America's Need for &quot;Rituals of Withdrawal&quot;</a></h5>
            <h3 align="center">Lesson 6 - Existential Questioning</h3>
            <p>Lesson six: &quot;Existential Questioning.&quot; During our third year, one of the things that puzzled me was 
              why it seemed that I was in a place that seemed so different from where everybody else was? Why did I feel like 
              such an outcast, such an &quot;Other?&quot; Pam and I are feeling very socially isolated. It's hard to start 
              new friendships. It's hard to get people willing to invest in a relationship with you when they know your limited 
              future and the challenges coming down the road for you. And I began to resent that. And I began to wonder what 
              is the relationship between being terminal and being mortal? An interesting question. What I figured out was 
              that the only difference between being terminal and being mortal was the time frame. Existentially they are 
              the same damn situation. Yet I was living in a society of people who denied that reality, a society made up 
              of people who considered themselves to be temporarily immortal, not vulnerable in the same way I was to death, 
              and yet they were and you all are. You're &quot;mortal&quot; to my &quot;terminal,&quot; and it's not all that 
              different. As a matter of fact, I discovered as I wrote the third meditation &quot;Are You Still Terminal?&quot; 
              that I wanted to be terminal for the rest of my life, no matter what happened with my cancer, because I thought 
              living in that kind of relationship with death had given my life a value that it never had before. There is 
              actually a very interesting literature that explores what life would be like if humans were immortal. Mortality 
              is actually a critical aspect of what makes us human. To be human requires the presence of death in our lives. 
              As a matter of fact, death as a number of philosophers have argued is what gives life its punch. It is what 
              many have called the wellspring of life; this business of living life up against the clock. That's what gives 
              life the force that it needs, otherwise there would be nothing that compelled us, that brought us to action. 
              So the metaphor that I began using was the metaphor of death as sugar. Think about death as what adds sweetness 
              to your life. </p>
            <p> That metaphor didn't just drop into my head. It was placed there through conversations with people who were 
              hospice patients, who shared with me that the time that they had as hospice patients was some of the sweetest 
              time that they had ever known. They told me that they were more open to love as dying people than they had ever 
              been before, and they were more capable of love than they had ever been before, and that it was death that made 
              it possible for them to know that and experience that. I had grown comfortable with the metaphor of having death 
              on my shoulder; death as a companion on this journey called life. And, yet, what I discovered, the more I thought 
              about it is no, death is right here inside of us. Death is the skeleton that is there in you, as much a part 
              of you as your flesh. That's the relationship that we need to cultivate. We need to aspire to a relationship 
              that would allow us to touch the skeleton we are becoming and to acknowledge and embrace that skeleton in each 
              other.</p>
