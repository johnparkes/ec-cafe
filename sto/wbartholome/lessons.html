            <h2 align="center">Lessons of the Angel of Death</h2>
            <h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>
            <p>In June of 1994, my life was visited by a teacher, the likes of which I had never previously encountered. From 
              this teacher I have been taught lessons in a way that I had never learned before. I have come to know things 
              about myself, about my profession and about this society that I never appreciated before. The mentor that has 
              been part of my life and so powerfully teaching me since June of '94 has been cancer, particularly metastatic 
              adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. From the time of my initial diagnosis, we have regarded this as my terminal 
              illness, and have attempted to live our lives up against that reality for almost five years now. </p>
            <p>For any of you who know anything about what is technically called Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, 
              that doesn't make any sense at all. People who undergo no treatment other than palliative surgery for this type 
              of metastatic cancer simply don't live for five years. So, ours is a very unusual situation. We have been provided 
              a rare opportunity for learning, for discovering. Obviously, I've learned through the illness experience. I 
              have learned only in the way that one can learn by being embodied and ill at the same time. I've learned about 
              what that meant in a way that I couldn't possibly learn from textbooks or professional journals or even by carefully 
              listening to patients and families describe their illness experiences. </p>
            <p>About six months after my initial diagnosis and surgery, I wrote a manuscript, a short story called &quot;A 
              World Unraveling.&quot; I wanted to convey in the story what happens when a person is given the diagnosis of 
              a terminal illness; to describe what changes about that person's life, their world. I also wanted to describe 
              the process by which the person's world first unravels and then begins to be re-constructed anew on the other 
              side of the diagnosis. Since then I have become aware that there is very little overlap between our world pre-cancer 
              and our world living with cancer. </p>
            <p>What I would like to share with you today is the lessons we have learned over the past five years; during the 
              construction of our post-cancer world. It is an autopathography which focuses on the lessons learned primarily 
              by the protagonist, his wife, children and family.
