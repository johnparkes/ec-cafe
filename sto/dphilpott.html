            <h1 align="center">David's Story</h1>
            <p>My name
                is David Philpott and I was born, 76 years ago, in White Plains
              New York. I moved to Canada in 1932 with my parents and have
              enjoyed a full and rewarding life here in Toronto ever since.</p>
            <p>In
                early March (2003) I experienced difficulty in swallowing. My
              GP Dr Henry Shub arranged a barium swallow followed by an Endoscopy
                    where
                  I was
                  told that a large tumor was growing at the base of my esophagus,
                  and it was malignant. This was serious stuff! I had previously
                  gone through an operation on my thyroid and an angioplasty
              but this was
                  different. In mid-March I met my surgeon of choice Dr. H.A.B.
                    Miller and he gave me the survival odds of EC and laid out
                    his recommendation
                  for treatment. At the same time, however, my 15 month old cocker
                  spaniel Robbie was diagnosed with a terminal liver condition
                    and had to be put down.This ordeal far overshadowed the cancer
                    and
                  it was a few weeks before I faced up to the gravity of my own
              situation.</p>
            <p>My ability to swallow had deteriorated and I was
                being fed through a tube but I started radiation April 21&#8212;a
              three week session
                    combined with 5 days of chemotherapy. I won't describe my
              response to the
                    chemo&#8212;I'm attempting to blot it out. It was the only really
                    hellish experience of the total process. Four weeks after
              the radiation,
                    right on schedule, I was in the operating room at Toronto's
                      Sunnybrook Health Science Centre. The procedure took five
                      hours and forty-five
                    minutes and he removed a much shrunken tumor and twelve lymph
              nodes (eight of which proved to be malignant.)</p>
            <p>              My recovery was slow but uneventful. Thinking positively,
                        I had my clothes altered to accommodate my svelte 172
                  pound body
                        (down
                        from
                        195) and I'd set goals for myself; like walk to the mail-box
                        without a cane eight days from now, drive to the cottage
                        by July 31, attend
                        my company board meeting on August 8th. I achieved them
              all!</p>
            <p>The fact that I could still have cancer in me was always
                          present but never front and centre. My family were
                  supportive beyond
                          all expectations&#8212;especially my wife who nursed me
                  through the whole
                          ordeal without a whimper. Over 50 friends phoned or
                  sent cards&#8212;I consider myself a bit of a loner so this surprised
                          me and
                          I now
                          appreciate the importance of these small gestures.
                  My
                      son and daughter-in-law, who live out of town, could not
                      have
                          been
                          more considerate and
                          helpful as were my step-daughter and family. This assistance
                          and concern
                          during the past months has meant even more to me than
                      the skill and care of the medical team. I have been treated
                          nurtured and cared
                          for by the absolute best and I shall be forever in
              their debt!</p>
            <p>In September, a cat scan discovered a couple of half
                            centimeter spots in my lung. This was the worst case
                            scenario and
                            both my wife and
                            I resigned ourselves to my death in a year or so.
                  Surprisingly this was not that terrifying&#8212;at 76 you have
                  a realistic
                            assessment of
                            your odds and although I'd rather not die any sooner
                            than necessary, I accepted the inevitable with a
                  sense of adventure.
                            What would
              it really be like after death?</p>
            <p>              I'm writing this now because a second (November)
                              cat scan has confirmed the disappearance of the
                  two offending
                              spots
                              and
                              I now have a second
                              kick at the can of life! I've been in touch with
                              our Spaniel breeder and we'll be taking delivery
                              of Robbie's
                              successor
              in February.</p>
            <p>I have been so much more fortunate than most EC
                                patients and I know I have been blessed with
                  an outstanding
                                hospital team,
                                a socialized
                                medical system that was always on time and never
                                let me down, and, above all the love of family
                                and friends,
                                without
                                which
                                I would
                                not
                                have survived. I may, and probably will, experience
                                a recurrence&#8212;the odds support this, but I can
                                now face
                                the future
              with confidence.</p>
            <p>And that's my story.</p>
