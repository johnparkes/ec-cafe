            <h1 align="center">Paula's Story</h1>
            <p><img src="/sto/pwatt.jpg" alt="Paula Watt (background) whith her friend best friend Jayne" width="300" height="270" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">My Name is Paula. I am a 41 year white female, married,  &amp; have
            4 children.  I smoked cigarettes and pot at a
            very young age, and also was addicted to Methamphetmine for 20 years.
              I smoke that too. I've been clean and
            sober now for 5 years. 
            In 1997 I began choking on food.  It would happen occasionally,
            but became worse as the years went by.</p>
            <p>By the year 2000 I could not
              hold anything down. Food would go down and within minutes I was
              gagging and
            sticking my fingers down my throat to get the food unstuck.  I
            thought it was because I had very few back teeth.</p>
            <p>Water would go down
              and then my throat would spasm and it would come back up. I ended
              up eating yogurt
            and ice-cream for a year and lost 50 lbs.  The choking was
            becoming such a problem,  I could not eat in public
            anymore, and my family was so worried.  It also became
            a problem at work.  I would sip on my coffee, while
            speaking with a patient on the phone, and start choking,  It
            was awful.</p>
            <p>I went to my Primary care Doctor at my HMO who referred
              me to an ENT DR. He had scoped my throat and said
            the was nothing &quot;remarkable about my throat&quot; He then
            cut a piece of my lip to rule out Srogrens disease.  I
            had
            barium swallows,  I then was referred to a Rheumatoid Arthritis
            Doctor. Finally my DR said &quot;Paula there's really
            nothing wrong with you&quot; She recommended a behavioral scientist.
            I thought I was about to faint. I couldn't
            believe she was saying this.</p>
            <p>Luckily I have two different insurance's
              and in my line of work (Respiratory Care) I knew a lot of Doctors.
              I went
              to a Gastroenterologist in Oct of 2001 and had an endoscopy done.
              That day I found out that I had a tumor the
              size of a lime in my upper esophagus, that wrapped around my
            thyroid, and also deviated my trachea.</p>
            <p>I was admitted into the hospital
              a day later. I was diagnosed with stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma.
              With no
              metastasis.  My treatment plan was chemotherapy Taxol
              + Cisplaton 4 days a week 24 hours a day.  And
              Twelve week of radiation 5 days a week.  I had
              to have a j- jostomy tube put in for feeding.  I was in the
              hospital
            November, December and part of January.</p>
            <p>I did very well with the
              therapy, only lost a little bit of hair in the back of my head.
              I just got real tired
              at the end of
              the treatments.  I did have to have 2 blood transfusions
              due to the chemo was killing my red blood cells in my
            bone marrow.</p>
            <p><em>Nov 29, 2003 -<br>
            </em>It's now been a year, and I had another
              Endoscopy done yesterday. So far so good. I decided not to get
              the
              esphagectomy operation because I would have lost my voice box.
               So the Doctors are just keeping a close eye
            on me.</p>
            <p>I really feel blessed that I've come this far.  All in
              all the whole experience with the treatment was not all that bad.
   
            I don't fall into the &quot;statistics&quot; so I guess
              I'm there miracle baby.  That's my story,  I'm
              alive, working 6 hours
            days,  eating my brains out!</p>
