            <h4 align="center">by Cathy Weeks</h4>
            <h2 align="center">The Waiting Game</h2>
            <p>November 22, 1996: We still have rough times. Dad, like many, many cancer survivors has been depressed at times, 
              not enjoying many of his old pursuits the way he once did. But Dad's oncologists say that this is very, very, 
              normal. Dad will get though this hurdle, just as he has all the others that came before it.</p>
            <p>On the physical that was required of him before he could lead the scouting trip in Minnesota, his doctor wrote 
              of his cancer status: "Full remission." There really is no word for Dad's condition. Remission usually means 
              that there is cancer present, but that it's not growing. Dad doesn't have cancer. But he isn't cured. Not yet.</p>
            <p><img align="right" src="/sto/cweeks/cathndad.jpg" width="163" height="231">It's a waiting game now. Dad's first milestone 
              is coming up. January of 1997 marks his one-year anniversary of his surgery, and completion of treatment. So 
              far, there has been no evidence whatsoever of recurrance. Dad has two very important statistical milestones 
              to come, though. Two years and then five years. Two years because that's survival time that cancer statistics 
              use most often, and five years because...after five years, he will be considered cured.</p>
            <p>It's hard to believe that one year ago, I was desperately searching the internet for information, looking for 
              others who had gone through it already. I met George Thompson, who is an active member of the EC-listserve, 
              and a wonderful storyteller to boot was the first person I talked to. Eventually I spoke with AL who 
              was looking to start a listserve devoted to Esophageal Cancer. He did it, and I volunteered to be the keeper 
              of Cathy's EC Cafe'. (The name of the page was Al's idea, actually).</p>
            <p>April 20, 1997: Chris and I got married on this rather rainy day, and Dad escorted me down the aisle, another 
              milestone for him and for me. Dad was very happy for me (and I for him), and despite his depression, enjoyed 
              himself a great deal.</p>
            <p>This is the part that is truely ongoing...I'll keep you posted about how Dad and I are doing</p>
            <p>March 29th, 2001: January 12, 2001 had come and gone, and the family barely noticed! A couple of weeks after 
              the fact, I realized, that OHMYGOD, DAD MADE IT PAST THE MAGIC 5-YEAR MARK!!! I called home, and Mom said that 
              Dad had just seen his surgeon a few days before, and he had declared Dad cured. Wow, the "good" C-word. I congratulated 
              Dad, who happily repeated the good news.</p>
            <p>Dad continued to deal with serious depression for a long time after my last entry. However, a combination of 
              factors has turned things around: His doctor finally hit upon the right anti-depressant, and his dental practice 
              picked back up. He was much happier being busy, and to our surprise, he got interested in his toys again (you 
              know, new digital camera, a new laptop, trying to figure out how to develop his xrays in less time, etc). We 
              had almost forgotten about his liking for gadgets. It's good to have him back.</p>
            <p>I no longer outweigh Dad (which always kind of bothered me...girls aren't supposed to weigh more than their 
              fathers!) He had always been pudgy, but after the surgery and recovery, he had trouble keeping his weight up. 
              At his smallest he weighed about 135 pounds (at 5' 7" tall). He's finally gained much of it back and now is 
              holding at around 165. It's a much better size for him. He still seems like a much older person than he did 
              before the cancer, but he's healthy, and that's what counts.</p>
            <p>It seems like I've barely blinked since the time I last wrote in this journal. Chris and I are approaching 
              our 4th anniversary (Time flies when you're having fun! :-). We're thinking of starting a family, and at almost 
              32 years of age, I hardly recognize the frightened person I was at 26 when Dad was diagnosed. But, life is good.</p>
