            <h2 align="center">The Treatment: Chemotherapy and Radiation</h2>
            <p>Monday, November 27th, 1995: Dad entered the hospital for treatment. He was undergoing what was called the 
              "Ann Arbor Protocol," which I was later to learn was the most harsh treatment protocol known. I'm not sure, 
              but I believe it was developed by Dr. Orringer. It basically meant 21 days of continuous IV chemotherapy treatment 
              and twice-daily radiation treatments (for a total of 30).</p>

            <p>They had Dad hooked up and the Chemo started within a couple of hours of his entering the hospital. They had 
              surgically implanted a catheter in a vein in his chest (much more convenient than a wrist, and I think they 
              needed a bigger vein) for the chemo and other drugs to enter his bloodstream. Dad dragged around a "tree" on 
              wheels that ALWAYS had a bunch of bags and tubes hanging from it. I found out later that the majority of what 
              went into his body was water. The drugs are so poisonous that they would destroy his kidneys if they weren't 
              continually flushed with water. As it was, he did sustain some kidney damage (as do 50% of all patients undergoing 
              this protocal) anyway--he had to take extra potassium for a few months after treatment. But his kidneys healed 
              up fine.</p>
            <p>Funny, the hospitals record EVERYTHING. As a result of all the fluids (water, chemo drugs, anti-nauseants, 
              etc), Dad had to urinate all the time, and of course they wrote down how much, how often, how much he ate, what 
              he ate, if he had a BM, EVERYTHING. I guess they needed that data. Another annoying thing is that the alarm 
              on Dad's IV pole was always going off. If it was low on batteries, if it was out of some drug, if a hose got 
              kinked and, it seemed much of the time that it would go off for no reason. A nurse would always come in and 
              fix it.</p>
            <p>The first week wasn't bad. Dad was fairly healthy to start with; regular exercize, a well-balanced diet, didn't 
              smoke or drink, etc. His good health made the entire treatment easier on him. He did better (ie. he was able 
              to eat all the way through the 21 days) than 90% of the patients that go through this protocol, and his good 
              health was a major contributing factor.</p>
            <p>Another contributing factor was his attitude. He WAS GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. He also renewed his faith in 
              God, and was listening to guided imagery tapes to help his body fight the disease. Dad consciously fought the 
              disease. And whenever he got depressed, he either requested or one of his doctors requested that Dad's counselor, 
              who is trained in hypnosis and cancer treatment, come see him in the hospital (which he did). He made a HUGE 
              difference, and really, really helped Dad maintain a positive attitude.</p>
            <p>That's actually one of my favorite pieces of advice for people in Dad's situation. GET HELP!! Whether it be 
              a clergyman/woman, a psychologist, or someone else. Someone who isn't a family member and thereby doesn't have 
              to deal with their own worries about the situation is a better and clearer-headed listener than a loved one. 
              I am NOT suggesting that family members be excluded. A counselor/psychologist is certainly not a replacement 
              for a loved one and vice-versa.</p>
            <p>I also did what I could to keep his spirits up. On his first day in the hospital, I brought him a computer 
              to play with. He hadn't used the World Wide Web much, and I thought he'd enjoy surfing to combat boredom. I 
              also attempted to give him some extra motivation to be stubborn and fight the disease. "Dad, you have to get 
              through this. I expect you to walk me down the aisle when Chris and I get married. And you know what else? Chris 
              and I plan on having children, and I want them to know their grandfather. And later on, Paul and Sean will have 
              kids, and *they* will need a grandfather. And next summer you are taking Paul camping at the Boundary Waters. 
              So you see, you really need to beat this disease." Dad smiled at me. "I will," he said.</p>
            <p>While Dad was getting his continuous IV chemotherapy, Dad also got Radiation twice a day during the business 
              week. He'd walk down to the radiation oncology offices, which were a surprisingly cheerful place, and get irradiated. 
              Prior to treatment, the doctor had shaved Dad's chest, and a spot on his back. In each area a rectangle was 
              painted on his skin, and were used to aim the radiation at the proper place. The machine used to irradiate cancer 
              patients looked like a massive Hobart mixer laid over on its side. A technician told me it weighed over 20 tons. 
              Dad would lay down on the table, which would then raise him up and over so that he was near the "Tuning fork" 
              which would pivot and rotate such that one arm was over Dad, and the other under him. Simultaneously, one arm 
              would deliver radiation to his front while the other did his back. A week and a half later, they painted new 
              rectangles on each side of his rib cage, and adjusted the machine so that radiation would come through his sides, 
              instead of front and back (It's to spread out the radiation so that it's less concentrated in the surrounding 
              organs).</p>
            <p>I visited Dad every day over my lunch hour during the week, and every day over the weekend. It was rough to 
              say the least. As I mentioned earlier, the first week wasn't bad at all. Dad was in good spirits, and he hadn't 
              yet experienced most of the side-effects of the treatment. The second week again wasn't as bad as any of us 
              were expecting. I never saw Dad's hair fall out, but he never vomited, and didn't lose all that much weight. 
              He was pale and tired, but mostly ok.</p>
            <p>But it was during this second week that we got some rather unsettling news. While I was visiting, Dad's surgeon 
              visited him for the first time, and told us a little about how he'd procede with the surgery. If at the time 
              of surgery, Dad's lymph nodes were clean, and the cancer hadn't spread, then he had an 85% chance of surviving 
              2 years. If his lymph nodes were involved, but the cancer hasn't spread otherwise, then his chances dropped 
              to 50%. And if the surgeon found that if the cancer had spread to outside the esophagus, then he'd close Dad 
              up without doing the surgery at all. I had to go back to work soon after this, but I understand from my parents 
              that the conversation was fairly brief.</p>
            <p>Two days later, the head of the oncology group visited us. I again happened to be visiting. Dad's doctor, whom 
              we didn't like very well (he was a competent doctor, but had a terrible bedside manner) was out of the office 
              that day, and the head of his group came by to tell us the results of the ultrasounds, which would reveal whether 
              or not Dad had lymph node involvement. The news was bad. The lymph node immediately adjacent to Dad's tumor 
              was indeed involved. We had been hoping for that 85% chance, and Dad visibly sagged in disappointment. "I had 
              hoped that wasn't the case," Dad told the doctor and I. "Well, I'm not great at reading ultrasounds. I can get 
              the radiologist to interpret them for you, if you'd like," the doctor said. "No, that's not necessary," Dad 
              replied.</p>
            <p>It was also during this time that an amusing (in a dark sort of way) event happened: Some of Dad's chemo drugs 
              spilled on the floor. Dad had gone to the bathroom, and rolled his IV pole over one of the dangling tubes, puncturing 
              it. We called a nurse, who called an "environmental mess" team, who came in wearing full-face masks, gloves, 
              plastic clothing, etc, to clean it up. Wow. I had had no idea that the stuff was so dangerous. The nurse told 
              me that Dad's chemo drugs were not nearly as bad as one other very corrosive chemo drug that would actually 
              burn if it got on the skin (!!). They merely try to minimize the exposure of hospital staff to these chemicals, 
              since they are around them constantly.</p>
            <p>The third week was a different story from the first two weeks. Dad clearly felt awful. He was weak, exhausted 
              and ready to go home. The doctors said that Dad was doing so well, that they expected him to be home for Christmas. 
              How could he be doing well, when he looked looked so wretched? Two things stick out in my memory during this 
              week: He laughed at some ridiculous story that I had downloaded off the net, and the laughter was so unanticipated, 
              especially with how awful he felt and how long since I'd seen him smile, that it brought tears to my eyes. And 
              it was during this week that he spoke to his counselor about dying. All along, he had been so *sure* that he 
              was going to make it. I hadn't realized how much Dad's certainty had given me hope, until he himself had doubts.</p>
            <p>Dad was on painkillers by this point. He didn't have the mouthsores that many others do (some medicinal gargle 
              prevented this), but his throat hurt terribly from the radiation, which I've been told is the part that tires 
              people out the most. He also had hiccups almost constantly, and few of the home remedies that people told me 
              about worked. The doctors tried different combinations of drugs, but to no effect. The hiccups, however, did 
              stop when he was sleeping. Sleep is a better muscle relaxant than any drug, it seems. By the end of his final 
              week, Dad was so weak, he could barely walk on his own.</p>
