            march 1995</h2>
            <p>On March 5, 1995, I was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, MN. Rochester Methodist Hospital and 
              St. Mary's, are both affiliated with Mayo, and St. Mary's is, from what I gathered, where they perform, the 
              major-league surgeries.</p>
            <p>The procedure I was about to undergo definitely qualified as a major-league surgery! It is known as in Ivor-Lewis 
              resection, or a Transthoracic Esophagectomy. The procedure is quite involved as the esophagus is not easy to 
              get at, since it lives in front of the spine, and behind the trachea. Open-heart surgery comes in second to an Ivor-Lewis.</p>
            <p> Basically there are two surgical sites - the first incision is down the front, from the diaphragm to the navel, 
              and it "mobilizes" the stomach (a nice way of saying they cut it loose).</p>
            <p>The second incision starts near the upper spine just inside the right shoulder blade, and proceeds down to 
              midway on the right side. From there they removed the bottom two thirds on my esophagus, along with twenty lymph 
              nodes, fourteen of which tested positive for cancer! Meanwhile, half of my stomach was also taken out, and the 
              remaining half was reshaped into a replacement esophagus.</p>
            <p>My surgery lasted just over five hours, and I was in intensive care for just under 18 more. This was a testimony 
              to Dr. Trastek's skill and the general quality of care at Mayo. </p>
            <p>My digestive tract is now highly optimized. The place where the "stomach thing" attaches to the esophageal 
              stub is called an anastomosis. It's basically a joint. The quality of the surgeon is important here, as the 
              anastimosis must not leak and hopefully won't scar too badly.</p>
            <p>My recovery period at St. Mary's, set at 12 days, was to allow the anastomosis to heal fully. The care was 
              excellent, and they had me walking the day after I came up from ICU. I had a morphine drip for several days 
              and had five various tubes sticking out interesting places of my body for longer than that - several of which 
              hadn't had holes for tubes before. I quickly learned that the respiratory therapist meant well and was not a 
              sadist at heart, although I didn't believe that for the first week, as I came to hate the Voldyne breathing 
              exercise. </p>
            <p><img src="/sto/mwolfgram/chicken.JPG" width="100" height="213" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0">My 
              friends from work sent me a care package, containing among other things, the rubber chicken that had graced 
              the top of my cubicle wall - I don't want to explain this any more than saying that software people collect 
              weird office art.</p>
            <p>When the box arrived a few days after surgery, Tammy opened it, and a note on top simply said "Cluck, Cluck, 
              Big Boy". I started laughing, which hurt more than the respiratory therapist's treatments, and begged Tammy 
              NOT to dig in the foam shipping peanuts... I knew the chicken was inside, and seeing it would probably kill 
              me outright.</p>
            <p>When she did pull it out, it was worse than anticipated... there was my rubber chicken, complete with a surgical 
              mask and rubber gloves on its feet. I hung it from my IV post, and it followed me around on my walks for the 
              rest of my stay. </p>
            <p>After serving my time, and passing the swallow test on my anastomosis,
              I was fed real food, and sent on my  way. My friends Peter and
              Cindy drove from Milwaukee to  Wisconsin Rapids to pick
              up Tammy, then to Rochester to 
              pick me up at St. Mary's. I watched "Coneheads" on
              the TV/VCR in in Pete's custom van during the three  hour drive
              home (and hurt like hell from all the laughing). My recovery at
              home lasted several
              more weeks, but 
              since my job is fairly sedentary, I slowly worked my way back to
              full time status within the month. </p>
