            <p>I'm one of the list owners for the Esophageal Cancer Group (EC-Group)
              on the <a href="http://www.acor.org/">Association 
              of Cancer Online Resources</a> (ACOR) list server. On February
              14, Valentines day, in 1996 the EC-Group was launched and at last
              count has almost  1,500 subscribers. It is a free forum for
              patients and caregivers to exchange information through e-mail
              about esophageal cancer. It is the largest support group for EC
              on the internet.</p>
            <p>ACOR has an extensive collection of support groups for a variety
              of cancers, including a support group for  cancer care givers &#8211;
              family and friends who provide the daily care of those of us stricken
              with one form or 
              another of cancer. Tammy and I are the also the list owners of
              Caregivers and we recommend it to anyone helping a cancer patient!
              We thank ACOR for providing a free home for the EC-Group and Caregivers. </p>
            <p>To subscribe to the EC-Group, send mail to <a href="mailto:LISTSERV@LISTSERV.ACOR.ORG?Subject=-">LISTSERV@LISTSERV.ACOR.ORG</a> 
              with the message containing only <b>SUBSCRIBE EC-GROUP <i>firstname
              lastname</i></b>. To also subscribe to Caregivers, 
              add this line: <b>SUBSCRIBE CAREGIVERS <i>firstname lastname</i></b>.</p>
            <p>There is an easier way, however, here at the <a href="/ecg/index.html">EC
                Caf&eacute; web page for
                the EC-Group</a>.</p>
            <h2>ec internet stuff</h2>
            <p>The oldest resource web site for Esophageal Cancer is this site ... Cathy's EC Caf&eacute;, 
              initially designed by Cathy Weeks in late 1995. I have always thought of the Caf&eacute; as the EC &quot;beacon&quot; on the web. It 
              has complemented the EC-Group list so completely that many members think of them as one entity. Tammy and I 
              are extremely proud to carry on Cathy's excellent work.</p>
    <p><a href="http://oncolink.upenn.edu/">OncoLink</a>, at the University of Pennsylvania is another great resource 
              for a variety of cancers and cancer treatments. They also have a page with <a href="http://www.oncolink.org/types/article.cfm?c=5&s=12&ss=769&id=9465">specific 
              EC references</a>.</p>
            <p>One particularly interesting study (no longer available on OncoLink <b><font size="-2">(5)</font></b>) compared 
              various EC treatment modalities: <a href="/sto/mwolfgram/whittington.html">Chemosensitized Radiation for Cancer of the Esophagus</a>, 
              compiled by Dr. Richard Whitington, is recommended reading. However I also add this disclaimer about his study: 
              The comparison of various treatment protocols lacks statistical uniformity. Look at it, study it, but &quot;squint 
              a bit&quot; at the numbers. Dr. Whittington presents good information when taken as TRENDS in treatment effectiveness.</p>
            <p align="center"> <i>Regardless of  studies, each patient will be either zero or 100% cured...<br>
          You have to believe that you will be in that 100% group of one!</i></p>

              <h6><strong>5 -</strong> I have quoted the &quot;Whittington Study&quot; as a touchstone since I first read it in 1996. I can 
                oly surmise that the concerns I have about statistical insignificance of the comparison of different oncology 
                studies and trials was the reason that it was removed from the OncoLink site.</h6>
              <h6>Since that study was published, chemosensitized radiation, combined with surgery has become the common treatment 
                method for EC.</h6>
              <h6>I was sent a copy of the original study web page several years ago, from someone who agreed that the overall
                 value of this information was important for those weighing treatment options. I contacted OncoLink with
                a 
                request to make the copy available on the EC Caf&eacute;, having received no response, I have made the page
                quietly available here.</h6>
