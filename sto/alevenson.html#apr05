            <h4><b>Personal History:
              </b>Written Christmas 1995 </h4>
            <p>I am a 58 year old white male living in the San Francisco Bay area since late 1987. For the 25 years before 
              that I've lived in Florida and the Caribbean. I am 5'7 a salesman, physically active, and -- just prior to surgery 
              -- described in my medical reports as in robust physical condition (and I'm back to that today).</p>
            <p>Before being diagnosed with esophageal cancer in April of 1995, I weighed about 160 pounds, I smoked for 37 
              years (probably 50-60 pack years). I had quit over 5 years before. Nearly a non drinker. Married for 17 years 
              until eight and a half years ago.</p>
            <h4><b>Symptoms and Diagnosis:</b></h4>
            <p>In March of 1995 I went for a routine physical just because I had not had one for three years. I had no symptoms. 
              I did mention to my doctor that about six weeks before I had a period of severe stomach acidity for several 
              weeks. I took a lot of alka seltzer, gave up coffee and tea. Began to drink about a quart of milk a day and 
              the upset went away.</p>
            <p>The blood test showed a little anemia. Doctor ordered an endoscopy. Endoscopy revealed a tumor which biopsied 
              positive. The tumor was rather advanced. I was referred to a surgeon who thought I would have 6 months if I 
              did nothing, 12-18 months if I did radiation and chemo and would do better with surgery. He proposed surgery 
              a soon as possible. No one suggested I consult with an oncologist. I did not. 
            <h4><b>Treatment:</b></h4>
            <p>I had the surgery on April 17th. Esophagus and part of stomach removed and resected. The surgeon said he got 
              everything he could see. He removed several lymph nodes most of which were positive for cancer. I was in intensive 
              care for five days; then moved to the general hospital population for two days.</p>
            <p>Went home and my sister came to take care of me for two weeks. I slept a lot. Tired easily. Found it difficult 
              to swallow, eat, and keep food down. I lost another ten pounds besides the twenty I lost in the hospital. The 
              wound in my throat got infected. Back to the hospital for a procedure to insert a drainage tube and a course 
              of antibiotics. Over the next ten days the antibiotics kicked in and I began to get better. I began to walk 
              a bit. I was able to walk a half mile or a mile although slowly and with several rest stops. Usually needed 
              a two hour nap afterward. But, could feel myself getting stronger every day. Ate a little better. Ate a lot 
              of Ensure Plus. As I was able to eat I ate lots of ice cream and heavy fattening foods. The weight came back 
              and stabilized at about ten pounds under previous weight -- that would be somewhere around week ten or twelve. 
              I tapered off the high fat foods and got some more protein in the diet.</p>
            <p>I increased the exercise. By ten or twelve weeks I was walking five miles 4-5 times a weeks. Back on my bicycle 
              and had done a few flat rides of 20-25 miles. I needed a nap of a hour or two every day. When I asked about 
              that, my doctors told me I was pushing too hard. I backed off a little bit. But, did not want to believe that 
              the exercise was bad for me. And in fact I felt better in every respect except the need for the naps. Somewhere 
              in that time period I was back at work part time.</p>
            <p>I felt like my mission for the first couple of months was to recover from my surgery. I had talked with a chemo 
              oncologist who said I should start chemo at about eight weeks and that I should concentrate on recovery and 
              weight gain in the meantime. I began to read about cancer in general, esophageal cancer, and alternative therapies.</p>
            <h4><b>Chemo and Radiation:</b></h4>
            <p>I had a couple of additional conversations with the chemo guy. Since he was very reluctant to participate in 
              any of the psychological aspects of healing, I began a serious search for another oncologist. I met another 
              oncologist that I liked who liked my chances with radiation and chemo. I felt better with her and decided to 
              go with her. However, my search had also taken me to MT Zion Cancer center in San Francisco. I already had an 
              appointment there so I went and had a set of CT scans and blood tests (this was at about week ten or eleven 
              after surgery). They advised that studies showed that radiation did not appear to improve longevity for people 
              in my stage of cancer. That I should return in three months and if the cancer had returned or appeared at any 
              other site, they would treat that. I thought about for several days and decided not to have radiation or chemo 
              for now.</p>
            <p>My search had taught me that there were some real down sides to radiation and chemo (not merely side effects 
              but actual damage to your body), there were some alternative therapies to pursue (none of which were recognized 
              by conventional Western medicine; they did, however, get a little faint praise from a minority and real support 
              from a handful of Western doctors).</p>
            <p>As time goes on my progress has continued steadily. I kept getting stronger. I did a challenging 60 mile bike 
              ride at about week 17. and an easy 65 mile ride at week 24 that was not even tiring.</p>
            <h4><b>Miscellaneous side effects and notes:</b> </h4>
            <p> Even before surgery my surgeon thought the cancer had probably metastasized. He felt a lymph node at my collar 
              bone which was enlarged and hard. He removed it during surgery and I biopsied positive. </p>
            <p>Immediately after surgery -- even before I woke up - I apparently suffered some respiratory distress. The breathing 
              tube which had been placed in my lungs was reinserted and remained for five more days. When it was removed I 
              was unable to speak, (I was able to whisper) my surgeon said it was a temporary paralysis and could last a few 
              days. As time progressed as I queried him further he said it was not unusual to last a week or two, several 
              weeks. He always suggested that if it lasted a couple of more weeks, it could be corrected surgically. After 
              about 5-6 weeks I went to see and Ear Nose and Throat Guy. He said if it persisted another month he would operate. 
              As I left his office I asked for a name of a speech therapist. I went to see him. He examined me and said I 
              had one paralyzed vocal cord, limited range in the other (you need both). And both were bent. Probably as a 
              result of the intubation. He gave me some exercises. I was immediately able to get some squeaks out. Three weeks 
              later I was talking normally. He regarded my recovery as extraordinary. It is an interesting lesson to be unable 
              to speak for two months.</p>
            <p>At month seven after surgery, I was back to work as full time as I want it to be. I've changed my work style 
              so that I work at home. I schedule in large portions of time for exercise, attending support group meetings, 
              and some time to read and study about nutrition and health.</p>
            <h4><b>Alternative Therapies:</b></h4>
            <p>I see an acupuncturist twice a month -- his practice is 50% cancer patients. I get some nutritional supplements, 
              and immune system assisting pills from him as well as some capsules of eight Chinese herbs which he says are 
              specific for esophageal cancer. I also drink Essiac tea.</p>
            <p>I consulted privately with a nutritionist. Although I was back to three regular meals a day and could eat solid 
              food, I was concerned that I seemed to be unable to put back the last ten pounds I had lost, that my bowel movements 
              were usually very runny, also I wondered if my flatulence was ever going to go away. She thought I was pushing 
              the exercise too hard. Advised me to graze five or six times a day rather than eat full meals. Suggested eating 
              a lot more grains, soy milk, fresh fruits and crucifeous vegetables. Wanted me get some acidophilus to supplant 
              the digestive bacteria in my intestines. (the flatulence came from incompletely digested carbohydrates) Suggested 
              I avoid red meat and switch to organically grown foods and drink spring water (I felt this advice was to relieve 
              load on my immune system in cleaning up the toxins in my body. ) She suggested I cut back as far as I could 
              on sugar and chocolate. She also said that I did not have to become a monk. I could treat myself to anything 
              I wanted if it were very infrequent. (You know, that is great advice. Had she told me I could not have something 
              I would have immediately begun to crave it. Since I had permission to have anything, I can wait months for a 
              little taste and do it without guilt).</p>
            <p><img src="/web/20100926123513im_/http://eccafe.org/sto/alevenson2.gif"  align=RIGHT border="0">I have done a little with mediation, guided imagery, Qi Gong. I'm not doing any of this on a continuing basis 
              but I believe I ought to.</p>
            <p>I feel strong and well and have been living my life fully 
              for several months. I have reconnected with my social life.</p>
            <p>I go to a support group at the Wellness Community. They are a non-profit and have support groups specifically 
              for cancer patients and separate groups for breast cancer, prostate cancer, support people and long term survivors. 
              They meet weekly and I attend about half the meetings regularly. I look in occasionally on another group that 
              is sponsored by the hospital where I had my surgery. I found still another group -- newly formed -- called Voices 
              in Healing which meets in San Francisco. It is available to people with life threatening diseases and their 
              support people. It includes AIDS people and as well as one person with Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p>
            <h4>Al's Affirmations</h4>
            <p>In the first days I was home after surgery, before I could remember how many boxcars were in the train that 
              ran over me, my sister, Elaine, came to stay with me. She wrote a little affirmation on a yellow post-it note 
              and stuck it on this mirror I have over a vanity. The mirror is huge -- like a sheet of plywood -- and inivited 
              more post-it notes which have slowly spawned.</p>
            <blockquote>

            <h4><a name="sep96"></a>Recurrance:
              Written September 1996</h4>
            <p>This is the news no one wants to hear about anyone. And no one wants to be telling it on themselves, but...</p>
            <p>On September 6th, 1996, I learned I had a recurrence of my cancer. It was an extension actually. A tumor which 
              probably began as a strand from the original tumor a year and a half ago lodged against a vertebra and has grown. 
              It has been dissolving the body of one vertebra and at its deepest penetration it is more than 50% gone. 
            <p>The worst news is that the vertebral erosion was noted when it was one fifth the size in report of a CT scan 
              I had last April. I was never told. And, apparently my oncodoc missed the significance of the report.</p>
            <p>When I learned of the current problem I went into high gear to determine where I stood, what was possible, 
              and what to expect. In the subsequent two weeks I consulted with the oncologist to whom my case had been turned 
              over. (Another story) Also saw my surgeon from a year and a half ago, a new oncologist that he referred me to, 
              another nationally renowned oncologist at Mt. Zion in San Francisco, and a radiation oncologist. I also had 
              a bone scan, MRI, and PET scan (a rather new super high tech imaging technique) I also met another surgeon and 
              was reviewed by the MT Zion tumor board.</p>
            <p>On the tenth of those whirlwind days I was laying on a table getting my body mapped for the radiation treatments 
              that I began two weeks ago. I had already learned there is no other occurrence of tumor visible to any known 
              test. (That is, of course, not to say there is none. There almost certainly is. But, my immune system has kept 
              it in check for a fairly long time and it is not likely anything else is aggressive enough to take me out in 
              the next six months.)</p>
            <p>So I have one tumor. And where it is and how to treat it is clear. It will very likely respond to radiation. 
              Better than even chance it will be eradicated by radiation and if not, the palliation will buy me a year or 
              two.</p>
            <p>Downsides of the treatment are some chance of paralysis because of the proximity to the spinal cord. That is 
              a small and acceptable risk. Some greater chance of some diminished physical ability -- but, again, tolerable.</p>
            <p>Surgery would be "heroic". At this point there is only one rather desperate scenario where I would consider 
              that. Even then it is doubtful.</p>
            <p>I have had only two difficult moments in this. One when I first saw the CT scan and the radiologist turned 
              to me with a sad look and said, "Didn't they say anything to you in April?"</p>
            <p>The other a week later when I had to tell my support group at the Wellness Community. They were devastated. 
              We've lost five precious people from the group in the last year. We've had one other recurrence and a number 
              of setbacks. We're always alert that someone may be slipping. We live and laugh our way through a constant roller 
              coaster. But, I've never seen the devastation as when I told them of my recurrence. More tears and more hugs 
              than there have ever been in the group. Everyone reached out to find a way to take some of the burden. Always 
              knowing that support does not change the solitary nature of going toe to toe with a tumor.</p>
            <p>And this speaks to the reason why I have not been able to post anything here until I knew where I stood, had 
              decided on a course of action, and took the time to craft to words by which I broadcast the news.</p>
            <p>After radiation began I set out to examine (in a phrase that Bjorn coined in a private message) the chemo card. 
              Thursday I will have a catheter inserted in my chest and Friday I get admitted to the hospital for two days 
              of chemo followed by two more outpatient days with an infusion pump. This will have some radiosensitizing effect 
              and some systemic value. The process will be repeated monthly three more times.</p>
            <p>The chemo was a much more of a decision. Since it stuffs the immune system which I believe has worked hard 
              and well on my behalf. But, just could not control one little piece that the surgeon could not see a18 months 
              ago. But it is a decsion that is behind me and I am relieved at the end of the research and resolved at the 
              beginning of the treatment.</p>
            <p>So there it is: the news and the op-ed page. Thanks in advance for all the well wishes, the prayers, and the 
              hugs.</p>
            <p>Luv, <br>
              Al</p>
            <p>PS. In the past many people have written to me after reading the first part of the story. But, I don't want 
              anyone to be hesitate about writing to me now because they think this is a bad time. If it is, I'll tell you 
              and refer your story on to one of my 100 plus pals, supporters, co-victors from the EC group. <br>
               
            <h4><a name="mar98"></a>The Beast's ambush is foiled:
              Written March 1998</h4>
            <p>It seems like a long time since I wrote that PS. It *is* a long time -- a year and a half. A lot of people 
              tuned in here in that time. Many wrote me notes. Some, clearly hesitant that it might not be appropriate, did 
              not know whether to send congrats or condolences.</p>
            <p>We never got close to condolences. The treatment was no picnic. But, as assaultive as it was, I always knew 
              this was just temporary. It was the price of teaching the Beast one more lesson. I never felt so bad that I 
              was tempted to just wallow in despair.</p>
            <p>If you read this far, you really want to know what the experience was like. For yourself or for someone who 
              really care about. So, I'll tell you without a lot of cosmetic makeover. I probably should have kept a journal. 
              I didn't. The memories are pretty clear.</p>
            <p>The radiation feels like nothing at all while its happening. You lay on a table. They go zap for a minute or 
              two. You get up and go on with your day. At least that is the way the first few weeks go. Then I began chemo. 
              The radiodoc had said that the chemo would add some extra sensitizing effect to the radiation. I was actually 
              anxious to get the chemo going.</p>
            <p>I chose to be admitted to the hospital for the 4 day chemo treatment. We suspended radiation for the week. 
              My chemo protocol was the standard one for EC. A few hours of cisplatin and four days of 5FU. I was given Kytril 
              to suppress nausea (which was extremely effective) and Licix to make me pee (which also worked). They really 
              don't want to chemo to stay in your body very long. They measure your urine output. By the same token you need 
              to consume a lot of water.</p>
            <p>I had been feeling so well prior to chemo that I thought I'd breeze right through it. I did for a day or two. 
              But, food did not interest me and I did not hydrate well enough. I began to feel tired. I lost several pounds 
              and wasn't too worried because I had been able to gain back most of the 30 pounds I'd lost after surgery.</p>
            <p>So I was tired. And slept a lot. And felt unmotivated. Not even motivated enough to get up and get something 
              to eat when I was hungry or something to drink when I was thirsty. I'd just sleep more. Later, someone explained 
              that with dehydration you lose your electrolytes and these are the body's neurotransmitters -- the messengers 
              that tell your brain that you are thirsty and the tell your butt to get up and get a drink.</p>
            <p>A couple of days after chemo a friend came over to mother me. She cleaned the apartment and did some laundry 
              and tried to get me to eat. I slept. She persuaded me that my sluggishness was cause for alarm. She took me 
              to see my oncodoc . I got on the scale and he noted the twelve pound weight loss (I didn't know *that*) and 
              marched my down to the clinic for a saline IV. I felt much better before the bag was empty.</p>
            <p>On the way home I stopped and bought some Gatorade. I was used to sports drinks from my hiking and bicycling 
              activities. I think they go down more easily than water and they have some sugar and some sodium and potassium. 
              To this day I keep a jug around and when I drink a couple of quarts a day I feel better.</p>
            <p>I finished up that round of chemo and went back for some more radiation. I was very tired. I tried to exercise 
              a little. But, it seemed like too much. I allowed myself to take it easy. The radiation went OK and I looked 
              ahead to the next round of chemo.</p>
            <p>I tried to fatten up a little with some rich foods and tried to get in the habit of drinking a lot of fluids. 
              I was trying to get ahead of the effects that I had experienced in round one.</p>
            <p>The second round I did a couple of days in hospital and a couple of days wearing a little portable pump. The 
              pump was not much bigger that a CD player, unobtrusive and not at all limiting.</p>
            <p>This time I had mouth sores.</p>
            <p>Every chemo has a large number of possible side effects. My observation is that everyone gets a couple of them. 
              The docs don't tell you much about them because they don't know which one <b>you</b> will get. Everyone asks 
              about losing their hair. Everyone shops for wigs or considers getting shaved. Nothing much happened to my hair.</p>
            <p>But those mouth sores were a bitch. They lasted about ten days. They were painful. I survived. I knew there 
              would be some price to pay.</p>
            <p>The fatigue got worse. It was a very good day that I only slept ten hours. Twelve to fourteen was getting to 
              be normal.</p>
            <p>So I was a lot less cocky about the next set of treatments. I think I had another ten radiation treatment and 
              the doc decided to give me a few weeks off so that I would not have to deal with such a double whammy. Possibly 
              because it was around Thanksgiving and I wanted a chance to enjoy some food. It kind of worked. No mouth sores. 
              I wasn't any more tired than I had been.</p>
            <p>Then I got the hemorrhoids. Never before. <b>Now</b> I knew what they were. Several days of discomfort over 
              the weekend. I had some passive advice from my GI guy that if they persisted over the weekend I should see someone 
              who could do an outpatient procedure in his office. I got to him first thing Monday morning. He did some cutting. 
              Nothing fun about that. But a couple of days late the relief was measurable.</p>
            <p>I think we stalled on the next round of chemo until after Christmas. My doc was going away and I didn't mind 
              downshifting a bit.</p>
            <p>A some point in here I had an xray of the site and the tumor had shrunk about 40%. That was great. Real reason 
              for optimism. I guess I finished the rad in December and had the last round of chemo in January of 1997. I was 
              pretty wasted. I wasn't an invalid; but, real low energy. I felt OK for 4-5 hours a day. The rest of the time 
              I was pretty sedentary.</p>
            <p>One of the characteristics of the energy is that when it ran out, it was like walking off a cliff. Especially 
              if I had been exerting myself. I was doing OK -- able to do routine things. And then I'd feel myself getting 
              heavy in the limbs. Over the next 15-20 minutes I just drained. I'd lay down as soon as I felt it coming on. 
              I'd sleep for two hours. If I was away from home, I'd stop whatever I was doing and headed for home. If I was 
              more than 20 minutes from home, the last minutes were pure will power.</p>
            <p>Once treatment was finished the low energy levels continued for a few more weeks and I got steadily better 
              over the next couple of months or so. I did push myself -- testing the energy limits. I didn't get all the way 
              back. But, it feels like 97%. 
            <p>There are a couple of more things to know about rad/chem. When you have finished the treatment, the positive 
              effects still go on: the residual effects lasts another six weeks or so. Point being that you <b>don't</b> get 
              to say to your doc right after treatment, "Let's get a scan and see how well we did." That comes six weeks later. 
              Your docs may forget to tell you about the six week wait.</p>
            <p>The other thing is that more than any other time when you are doing rad/chemo you <b>feel</b> like you are 
              engaging the Beast. You <b>feel</b> like you are fighting back. You <b>feel</b> like you are <b>not</b> laying 
              down and waiting for the dice to roll. You are in the game. And for me it was the perfect time to enlist some 
              of the psychological and spiritual tools.</p>
            <p>Specifically, I did visualizations during the minutes I lay on the radiation table. I visualized the rays attacking 
              the tumor and peeling layers off the big mass of jelly. The cells turned to dust and my immune system swept 
              up the dust and expelled it. I actually paced the visualization over the 35 treatments and it included the rebuilding 
              of the bone loss after the tumor had been destroyed. I didn't quite time it right. The rebuilding process finished 
              a couple of days too soon so I had to add a couple of extra protective layers to the repaired vertebral body.</p>
            <p>You may find this psychological stuff hard to swallow. That's OK. I believe that it can't hurt. It was one 
              more way I engaged the Beast and who knows which treatment worked or how they combined to work.</p>
            <p>What I do know is that my docs looked at the pictures six weeks later and said, "I think we killed it."</p>
            <p>The really good news is that I'm writing this story a year later.</p>
            <p>Throughout 1997 I got better. Just like after surgery. I've had my tux on three times for some formal balls 
              and danced my legs off until 2 am. I've logged a couple of metric centuries (63 miles) on my bicycle. I played. 
              I worked. I traveled. I appreciated. All with more awareness than ever before.</p>
            <p>I collected my Three Year Victor pin a month ago. I've watched the EC group grow from that 100 pals that rooted 
              with me to 475 today. I know two dozen people who are further down the road to victory than I am. So I know 
              it can be done. I've heard there are a few docs that say a diagnosis of stage 3 EC is a death sentence. I'm 
              sure glad none of *my* docs thought that way.</p>
            <p>Now, I know you did not read this story because there was nothing on TV. You strolled into this Cafe because 
              you or someone important to you has EC. And probably you just found out. You are probably pretty happy to find 
              a three year victor especially if you just talked with one of those Dr Doom guys. Maybe you'd like to tell me 
              your story and ask me what you should do.</p>
            <p>You <b>are </b>welcome to drop me a note. There is a link to me email box below. The advice I will give you 
              is to join the EC group listserve. (It is free) And the instructions to get on that mailing list <a href="/web/20100926123513/http://eccafe.org/ecg/index.html">[are 
              here]</a>.</p>
            <p>In that group there is a ten year victor. It is run my volunteers who are not doctors. But, whose collective 
              experience is huge. So, if you want to tell your story, wait until you can tell it to hundreds of caring people.</p>

            <h4><a name="oct02"></a>A 
              postcard from AL:
              Written October 2002</h4>
            <p><img src="/web/20100926123513im_/http://eccafe.org/sto/alevenson3.jpg" width="200" height="206" align="right" border="0" hspace="10">Life is busy. Life is full. Life is rich. Life is sweet. So this long overdue update will be brief. The truth 
              is the news is noteworthy only by its absence of grim medical reports.</p>
            <p>After five and a half years of clean scans, I am officially deemed cured of EC according the guidelines of 
              the National Cancer Institute. The events of April 1995 were an hourly thought in my mind for so many years, 
              a thought that faded slowly. Sometime in the last couple of years I realized that I no longer thought about 
              the presence of microscopic clusters of EC cells in my body. I began to embrace the notion that I was a cancer 
              victor rather than a cancer patient. I never did think of myself as a cancer victim. </p>
            <p>Today, a couple of 
              months shy of my 66th birthday, my body is as strong and hard as it has ever been. In March of this year, about 
              a month before the five year anniversary of the first clean can after tx for the recurrence, I realized this 
              wonderful anniversary was nigh. And, in some strange sort of way I wanted to pay homage to my body for its victory 
              -- and one last time -- Flick the Bird to the Beast. I dusted off my bicycle little used during '01 and began 
              to ride several times a week. It was almost compulsive. Seven months later the victory lap is over 2000 miles 
              long and growing.</p>
            <p><img src="/web/20100926123513im_/http://eccafe.org/sto/alevenson4.jpg" width="213" height="320" align="right" border="0" hspace="10">The EC Group continues to thrive and grow. Over 1100 members currently avail themselves of the daily publication 
              of information and support of veterans and victors, of friends and fellow travelers. Over 4000 thousand have 
              visited since Christmas Eve of '95 when I first invited a half dozen lonesome EC cowboys to exchange thoughts 
              with each other via the 'net.</p>
            <p>I am not so visible in the daily postings as I was in the early years. So many wonderful people have taken 
              up the challenge of posting wonderfully caring, knowledgeable and thoughtful responses. I still get personal 
              email, phone calls and referrals from several sources and take pleasure in the personal one on one contact.</p>
            <p>I have learned that people who join the EC group have a longevity substantially greater than the statistical 
              average. That is not just a statistical anomaly. People who are pro-active in the defense of their health do 
              better. They have encouraging family and friends. Their physicians are impressed with their knowledge and determination 
              and pay closer attention. They live their lives more richly even as they endure the assault of treatment. Rather 
              than be debilitated by it, they take energy from their fight with the Beast. Fighters live longer and they live 
              their lives more richly as they fight.</p>
            <p>And those who begin sharing the story of their victories -- even the tiny milestones on the path to victory 
              -- do even better. When I was dx, the average longevity was 19 months. What would you say the odds would be 
              of three random people diagnosed within a month of each other would beat the 19 month average? What are the 
              odds that they beat it by double? By triple?</p>
            <p>Over 100 months ago in the Spring of 1995 a retired air force colonel in Texas, a young grandfather software 
              engineer in Wisconsin, and professional pleasure boater in the San Francisco Bay area were dx with EC. Rather 
              advanced EC at that -- all stage threes. Between them there were a couple of dozen hot lymph nodes. They came 
              together to become the nucleus of the EC Group. And George Thompson, Marc Wolfgram and myself are all around 
              today. </p>
            <p>A miracle? Three miracles? Coincidence? Luck? Who cares? But, I have come to believe that positive attitudes 
              heal. And mentoring stokes the immune system.</p>
            <p>Life is busy. Life is full. Life is rich. Life is sweet.</p>
            <p>And, I am grateful.</p>

            <h4><a name="apr05"></a>Double victory lap:
            Written April 2005 </h4>  
            <p>Ten years ago day I had surgery. The last celebration date was February of '02 &mdash; the fifth anniversary of the successful tx for the recurrence. I celebrated quietly. I don't really recall what I did but I knew I was entitled to a victory lap. Today seems like a good day for another.</p>
            <p> I congratulate Marc and George for their successful ten year journeys. I pay homage to the two dozen heroes who were awarded their ten year pins before I did and who are well along adding chevrons to their sleeve. </p>
            <p> <img src="/web/20100926123513im_/http://eccafe.org/sto/alevenson5.jpg" width="250" height="286" hspace="5" border="0" align="right">I don't know that I have a lot to report besides that I am alive and well, hale and hearty, past being giddy with gratitude. And on to feeling entitled to my energetic existence.</p>
            <p> I have no wish to detail the adventures, the laughs and loves of the last ten years. But, they have been the best ten years ever. Maybe every little cameo experience was a little sweeter because I cheated the Beast. Although I already knew how to wring an extra measure of joy and pleasure out of every step of the dance. Maybe just because the odometer clicked over into my sixties and everything works as well as it did ten or fifteen years ago. </p>
            <p> If had not out wrestled the Beast ten years ago and had known what I was going to miss, I'd have been really upset. But, I did. And, I didn't. And, I am not. But, I do pause to send you this postcard and note my gratitude for the last ten years. A short pause. Because I am busy savoring what to do with the next ten. See ya.</p>
