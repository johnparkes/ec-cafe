            <p align="center">February 19, 1944 - August 2, 1999</p>
            <p>Dr. Bill came to the EC-Group with the "Angel of Death living on his shoulder." He was insightful, often controversial, 
              and always willing to share his medical knowledge. His had an impact on everyone that he came into contact with. 
              I had many good philosophical debates with Bill, and miss his presence a great deal. <i>-- Marc</i>
