            <h4 align="center">March 17, 1940 - April 13, 2004</h4>
            <p>To My Beloved Jimmy,</p>
            <p>Our journey began 33 years ago, but it was this last year that
              forever changed our lives.</p>
            <p align="center">On April 2, 2003, you were diagnosed with esophageal cancer.</p>
            <p><img src="/mem/joshea.jpg" alt="James & Margaret O'Shea" width="292" height="286" border="0" align="right">The statistics given at Moffitt Hospital were devastating to
              us. However, our radiation oncologist told us he was going for
              the cure. That gave us hope and courage to stay the course.</p>
            <p>I made a promise that I would be with you every day, and for that
              year we were inseparable. Our enthusiasm and passion to get well
              was boundless. And our love for each other was unconditional.</p>
            <p>It was perhaps the first time that I truly understood and relied
              upon your tremendous sense of humor and impeccable timing.</p>
            <p>You endured a year of endless testing and treatment and often
              recounted the number of trips to Moffitt and the number of needle
              sticks per day. To those who cared for you, you never lost your
              patience or charm.</p>
            <p> During our last week, while in the care of hospice, you said, <em>&quot;We
              are not giving up. We are resting to see which way we go. The rest
              can't hurt and may improve the situation.&quot;</em></p>
            <p> Then as the days progressed you wrote, <em>&quot;A
                year is too much. I need some relief. You are brave. I will watch
                out for you like always. I have to go Tell all how much I love
              them.&quot;</em></p>
            <p> We all prayed for a miracle and indeed it happened.</p>
            <p> You died peacefully at home, during the holiest days of Easter. </p>
            <p> The moments before your passing you relaxed your neck and laid
              your head back so gently on your pillow and you lightly pulled
              my right hand, which I had placed in your right hand over to your
              heart. Although you had been unresponsive for 24 hours, as you
              drew your last breath, you knew Patti and I were with you. </p>
            <p> April 13 was your mom's birthday, so as not to miss any of the
              celebrations you left really early at 2 AM.</p>
            <p> The cyst on your back, which was discovered in early December
              and had led to an additional diagnosis of bone metastasis, was
              healed.</p>
            <p> And amazingly you never suffered the pain of bone cancer. </p>
            <p> God did listen to all our prayers and answered them the best
              way possible.</p>
            <p> I asked you one question and requested one favor. </p>
            <p> Who was going to meet you? Initially you said, <em>&quot;It is
                too early to determine this.&quot;</em> Later you told me, for sure it would
              be your mom.</p>
            <p> I wanted you to send me messages. You said, <em>&quot;give me
                time to learn the ropes.</em>&quot; You learned pretty quickly because the
              next day they began. </p>
            <p> There are so many to thank. </p>
            <p> My parents &amp; sisters, Patti, Josie &amp; Karen, you shared
              our tears of joy and sorrow each step of the way. Mom, you sent
              cards every week for over a year. Patti, you watched our
              dogs each time Jim was hospitalized and stayed with me those last
              days, so I could get some rest.</p>
            <p> James, Douglas, Keith &amp; Mark, Jim's children and Tom his
              only brother, called, visited and told him you loved him a hundred
              times over. He never tired of listening to this and often would
              cry later, saying he never knew how much he was loved.</p>
            <p> Susan, our nurse practitioner, you cared for Jim with exquisite
              love and kindness, giving expert medical care and never tiring
              in our relentless effort to make him well.</p>
            <p> Patricia, Office Manager at our clinic, you understood the urgency
              of my<br>
              numerous phone calls and requests. You were always patient and
              good natured and we loved you for that.</p>
            <p> To all our friends, neighbors, and fellow cancer survivors: you
              were such an inspiration and an important part of our lifeline.
              You called, sent cards, well wishes, prayers and food. On his last
              night with us, we sat together and cried and prayed with him, again
              giving him permission to go forward and telling him how much we
              loved him.</p>
            <p> Jimmy, you are my best friend and as you promised, you are helping
              me to have the most intense feeling of peace. I am no longer afraid.
              I will live my life realizing all is well. Nothing is past; nothing
              is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before &mdash; only
              better, infinitely happier and forever &mdash; we will all be one together
              with Christ.</p>
            <p> I know you are waiting for me just on the other side of the fence.</p>
            <p> I love you.</p>
            <p> Margaret</p>
            <hr>
			<p>To My Jimmy,</p>
			<p> We are all together here today by virtue of a common thread.<br>
  That thread is Jim O'Shea.<br>
  To one he was a spouse, a soul mate.<br>
  To others, he was a father, a brother, a friend.<br>
  To me, he was many of those.</p>
			<p> They say the measure of man's life is how he influences those with whom
			  he comes in contact.</p>
			<p> It is an honor to be able to tell you how Jim......Jimmy influenced my
			  life, from the time I was a young girl, to his last earthly day, when he
			  went on to better things, a better life.</p>
			<p> When I was young and wanting to live in New York, Jimmy reached out with
			  an open heart and aided my in my quest.</p>
			<p> He showed an eagerness to help in whatever way he could; whether it was
			  finding my first job, learning to &quot;survive&quot; in the Big City, or
			  just to offer a calming, reassuring hand when things didn't go my way.</p>
			<p> He showed compassion when you were down, and let you know that he would
			  always be there if you needed him.</p>
			<p> Undoubtedly, things didn't always go Jimmy's way either, but he showed
			  affection for me and his wisdom by teaching me to deal with life's setbacks
			  with character, kindness, and a healthy dose of humor.</p>
			<p> Jimmy was generous in many ways, he offered encouragement and advice;
			  never preaching but instead always making one feel as if they had arrived
			  at a realization all on their own.</p>
			<p> He took delight in the accomplishments of others, and derived satisfaction
			  from knowing that perhaps, in some manner he had assisted them.</p>
			<p> Jimmy was generous in giving of himself and of what he had.</p>
			<p> I always had to be careful of saying I liked something, because next thing
			  you know, Jimmy would offer to give it to me, except for his Big Screen
			  TV......hmmm.</p>
			<p> I've always felt that Jimmy was a big fan of mine, because that is what
			  he conveyed to me in his words and his actions. That you could accomplish
			  what you set out for, that you could learn new things, expand your horizons
			  and that you could have a good time doing it.</p>
			<p> I know I've always been a Big fan of Jimmy, for his attitude on life,
			  his optimism, and his willingness to share those attributes with me.</p>
			<p> Though he never understood that not everyone wanted to spend ALL DAY on
			  a boat to catch that Big Fish, his optimism was contagious.&nbsp; It almost
			  DID make you want to spend ALL DAY on that darn boat.</p>
			<p> When Jimmy learned he had cancer, it was the saddest day of my life, but
			  Jimmy was eternally optimistic and was determined to beat it.</p>
			<p> The last year of Jimmy's earthly existence was one of great swings, moments
			  of tremendous fear and sorrow, to moments of hope, faith, trust, loyalty
			  and LOVE.</p>
			<p> Jimmy was always willing to stand with you, as he did for so many years
			  with Margaret, his wife whom he loved so dearly.</p>
			<p> I know that Jimmy's greatest fear and disappointment was that he would
			  not &quot;physically&quot; be present at Margaret's side to support her,
			  to comfort her. Instead he is now doing it spiritually.</p>
			<p> Jimmy came to realize that having trust in hope and in faith would not
			  only provide for Margaret, but for himself as well.</p>
			<p> Jimmy allowed me to share in the most intimate and personal moments of
			  his life, the time when one is the most vulnerable; I will be eternally
			  grateful to him for that. </p>
			<p> During those times, he taught me courage, grace, dignity and to trust
			  that no matter what happens or when our time comes we will never loose our
			  connection.</p>
			<p> Our Love is woven like a tapestry, Jimmy is a thread in that tapestry
			  as are we all.</p>
			<p> It will only grow larger and warmer as we all continue on with the journey
			  that is life.</p>
			<p> Love, Patti (Jim's sister-in-law) </p>

			<p>Memories of Jim O'Shea</p>
            <p> We first saw Jim on a New Year's Eve. Margaret had called
              and told us to be sure to watch a certain New York TV station,
              that she would be on it with a friend. Sure enough, the camera
              picked up on Margaret and her friend, who turned out to be Jim
              O'Shea.</p>
            <p> While visiting Margaret sometime later, we were introduced to
              the &quot;Likable Irishman&quot;, who was to become a good friend
              over the many years that we came to know him.</p>
            <p> One of Jim's passions was fishing. For many years he would
              spend his weekends at Sheepshead Bay. He got to know many
              of the boat captains as well as the best part of the boat decks
              to reserve for his fishing spot.</p>
            <p> On occasion, I would meet him there and we would have a good
              time fishing for flounder and blue fish.</p>
            <p> Jim also had a passion for boats. He finally bought one,
              a good seaworthy boat and took lessons so he would know how to
              handle it. We had happy times fishing in the waters of Jamaica
              Bay.</p>
            <p> Another passion of Jim's was his desire to have a log cabin in
              the mountains of eastern Pennsylvania. He found an area that
              he and Margaret liked, bought some property and had the log cabin
              built. We spent many enjoyable weekends with Jim and Margaret
              at their cabin in the woods and nearby lake. Jim was always
              a great sport about putting worms on Loretta's hook.</p>
            <p> When he and Margaret went house hunting again, we were happy
              to hear them say that they could not find anything interesting
              in Arizona; that would have been such a long ways away. As
              it turned out, their choice of a home in Florida was the right
              one.</p>
            <p> For when Jim became ill, Patti was there to give support and
              a helping hand when it was sorely needed.</p>
            <p> And so we will add one final good-bye. May you rest in
              peace. We love you and we will miss you.</p>
