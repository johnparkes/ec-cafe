      <p><em>&quot;My partner passed a couple months ago and my first instinct was to stop coming to the LIST.  But I had so many messages that showed others' concern for me, that I began to wonder if I stayed that I might help someone else, even if in a small way. So far, I don't suppose I have, but I have hopes of being useful.&quot;</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center">This was the response from <a href="mailto:nwestacott@SYMPATICO.CA?subject=ECCafe">Nancy Westacott</a>.<br>
    Her post expresses the community that is EC-Group.</p>
    <p>For M&mdash; and anyone else who wonders if staying on the list does any good.</p>
<p>I found this list the night was I was diagnosed, through Cathy's EC Cafe. Within 24 hours of posting my story I had emails from all over the world telling me that I too could beat the beast.  One of those emails was from Jane Pickett, our 35 year survivor. Some of those who emailed me are no longer with us and that makes me sad. That was almost 5 years ago.</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine my life without this list.  I have laughed with all of you and cried with all of you. You make me smile, you make me laugh and someday you make me downright angry but I still come back, day after day.  Some days, this is home more than my physical home is. </p>
<p>We all have something to contribute - whether it is good, bad or indifferent.</p>
<p>The friends I have made from this list will always be my friends which is a little strange considering that for the most part I wouldn't know you from Adam walking down the street.  Those of you I have had the honor of meeting will forever be ingrained, not only in my head but also my heart. </p>
<p>As most will admit, this is not a group anyone wants to join, but once in, always in. </p>
<p>For me, leaving would be like cutting of a limb and sorry folks, but I have lost enough body parts to this disease as it is, I refuse to give up anymore.  Perhaps it is the comfort of knowing that everyone here has been there, done that and won't think that my questions and or suggestions are totally whacked! (Just a little bit, because, hey, it is me after all LOL).</p>
<p>So M&mdash;, don't ever think that you are not helping someone because somewhere out there, someone will sleep a little better tonight, eat a little better tomorrow, and feel a whole lot better due to you!!!</p>
