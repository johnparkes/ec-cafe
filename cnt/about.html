            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This web site contains information gathered by esophageal cancer patients and non-medical caregivers. The purpose is to help others that are coping with esophageal cancer, possibly for the first time, to gain insight into this disease.</p>
            <p>We strongly endorse the initiative of the <b><a href="http://www.hon.ch/">Heath on the Net Foundation</a></b>, and believe in the honest, ethical presentation of health related information.</p>
            <p>We encourage anyone encountering incorrect or misleading information on the Caf&eacute; to please help us by bringing it to our attention immediately. Contact Information is at the end of this page.</p>
            <h3>Medical Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>Much of the information found here is anecdotal - that is &quot;personal experiences&quot; - and not intended to be used as medical advice. You can use this information to perhaps better understand this thing called EC, BUT you should ALWAYS defer to your doctor, oncologist, surgeon or other medical professional. This information is NOT intended as a substitute for qualified medical care.</p>
            <p>We are NOT medical professionals, nor are a majority of the contributors to this website.</p>
            <p>There are links to researched medical information. Some of it is dated. Typically published information runs 5 to 7 years behind current medical trends.</p>
            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p> Confidentiality of data relating to individual patients and visitors to a medical/health Web site, including their identity, is respected by Cathy's EC Caf&eacute;. Marc and Tammy Wolfgram undertake to honor or exceed the legal requirements of medical/health information privacy that apply in the the United States of America, where this web site is located.</p>
