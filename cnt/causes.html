              <h1>Who Gets EC, and What Causes It?</h1>
            </center>
            <h4 align="center">by Cathy Byland Weeks</h4>
            <p>This is a hard question. Who gets EC? Why do they get it?</p>
            <p>Well, the key word is "tends." Certain people tend to get EC,
while others don't.</p>
            <p>For example, African Americans tend to get the disease more often
than European Americans, and men get it a lot more often than women do.
For every woman that I hear of with this cancer, I hear of at least 3 or
4 men that have it. But why? I'm not certain, but I think men have trouble
with heartburn more often than women. What is it about men that predisposes
them to this? What is it about women that protects them? In an attempt
to answer this rhetorical question, I recently had a conversation with
a female Esophageal Cancer patient, and it went something like this:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><b>Q:</b> What sets you apart? Most Esophageal Cancer patients are men. You fit the profile for EC in that 
                you had had long-term acid reflux but there are people out there who have reflux, and never get cancer. Someone 
                once accused EC of being a sexist disease (gee, aren't you glad you broke through *that* glass ceiling! ;-) 
                and it seems at times that it is.</p>
              <p><b>A: </b><i>I've asked myself many times--Why Me? I smoked about a pack a day when I was in college, but 
                haven't had a whole cigarette in probably 25 years, and haven't had a puff in at least 15 years. I try to 
                stay away from secondhand smoke and really have little trouble avoiding it. As for alcohol consumption--very 
                little, maybe 2-3 weak drinks a month, and no beer. So other than the chronic reflux there just doesn't seem 
                to be an explaination for it all--just the luck of the draw I guess!!!</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Generally speaking, people who have had chronic heartburn or "acid-reflux," over a long period of time tend 
              to be much more at risk of getting EC. Long-term irritation of the esophagus causes a condition called "Barrett's 
              Esophagus," a condition in which the cells of the Esophagus change to resemble stomach-lining cells, rather 
              than Esophageal cells. Barrett's Esophagus is considered a pre-cancerous condition.</p>
            <p>Smokers and drinkers also tend be higher risk, but people who
both smoke AND drink are at a MUCH, MUCH higher risk. Somehow the interaction
of smoke and the alcohol within the body seems prime the esophagus for
cancer.</p>
            <p>However, why do some people get it and not others? My father's
family has no history of cancer whatsoever. Dad used to drink, but quit
entirely back in 1974. Not a drop of alcohol in over 20 years. He used
to be a pack-a-day smoker, but he quit smoking the day I was born, back
in 1969. The studies of EC don't say too much about smokers and drinkers
who have been "on-the-wagon" for long periods of time. If Dad had never
smoked or drank, would he have gotten cancer? Who knows.</p>
            <p>Dad ate a healthy, well-balanced diet, exercized regularly, and
took care of himself. He was slightly over-weight, but his weight never
fluctuated much. Dad rarely even caught colds. However he had acid-reflux,
but was unaware of it. Bingo.</p>
            <p>But what about the people (and there are plenty of them) who get
EC, and don't fall into a single high-risk category? Why do they get this
disease? Genetic tendency maybe. Environmental factors possibly. High stress
levels or traumatic life events are considered by many to be among the
causes of cancer. But plenty of people live high-stress lives and never
get the disease.</p>
            <p>So why do people get cancer? I guess the female EC patient I spoke
to said it best:</p>
            <p>It's "just luck of the draw!!"</p>
